New Para:  1 When Gandhiji was 15, he had removed a bit of gold from his brother’s
armlet to clear a small debt of the latter. He felt so mortified about his act that he
decided to make a confession to his father. Parental forgiveness was granted to him in
the form of silent tears. The incident left a lasting mark on his mind. In his own
words, it was an object-lesson to him in the power of ahimsa.
The original not being available; his own report of it, as found in An
Autobiography, is reproduced here.
2 According to Mahatma Gandhi : The Early Phase, p. 212, one of the senten-
ces in the confession was : “So, father, your son is now, in your eyes, no better than a
common thief.”
3 Gandhiji was given a send-off by his fellow-students of the Alfred High
School, Rajkot, when he was leaving for England to study for the Bar. In An
Autobiography, Pt* I, Ch* XI, he says : “I had written out a few words of thanks. But I
could scarcely stammer them out. I remember how my head reeled and how my whole
frame shook as I stood up to read them.”

I am sorry that there has been no letter from you for the last two
or three weeks. Your silence is due perhaps to your not having heard
from me. But it was impossible for me to post any letters before I
reached London. That you should not have written to me on that
account is indeed surprising. As I am far from home we can meet
only through letters. And if I do not get letters I feel very much
worried. Therefore please drop a postcard every week without fail. I
would not have been anxious if you did not have my address. But I
am sorry that you have stopped writing after having written to me
twice. I joined the Inner Temple on Tuesday last. I will write in detail
after I hear from you next week. The cold here is now bitter but such
bad weather generally does not last long. In spite of the cold I have no
need of meat or liquor. This fills my heart with joy and thankfulness.
I am now keeping very good health. Please give my respects to
mother and sister-in-law.

1, I had a chat with Jayshankar Buch. During the chat he
advised me to apply to the Junagadh
2 State to give me a scholarship to
proceed to London, I being an inhabitant of Sorath
3* I do not
perfectly remember the answer I made to him that day. I suppose I
felt the impossibility of getting the scholarship. From that [time] I had
in my mind the intention of visiting the land. I was finding the means
to reach that end.
On 13th April, 1888, I left Bhavnagar to enjoy the vacation in
Rajkot. After 15 days of vacation, my elder brother and I went to see
Patwari. On our return my brother said : “We would go to see Mavji
Joshi
4“, and so we went. Mavji Joshi asked me as usual how I did.
Then put some questions about my study in Bhavnagar. I plainly told
him that I had hardly any chance of passing my examination first
year. I also added that I found the course very difficult. Hearing this,
he advised my brother to send me as soon as possible to London for
being called to the Bar. He said the expense will be only Rs* 5,000*
“Let him take some urad dal. There he will cook some food for
himself and thereby there will be no objection about religion. Don’t
reveal the matter to anybody. Try to get some scholarship. Apply to
Junagadh and Porbandar States. See my son Kevalram
5, and if you fail
in getting the pecuniary help and if you have no money, sell your
furniture. But anyhow send Mohandas to London. I think that is the
only means to keep the reputation of your deceased father.” All of
our family members have great faith in what Mavji Joshi says. And
my brother who is naturally very credulous made a promise to Mavji
Joshi to send me to London. Now was the time for my exertions.
On that very day my brother, notwithstanding his promise to
keep the matter secret, told the thing to Khushalbhai
6* He, of course,
approved of it in case I could observe my religion. The very day it
was told to Meghjibhai
7* He quite agreed with the proposal and
offered to give me Rs* 5,000* I had some faith in what he said. And

from him when the time comes, which she thought never will come.
On that day I was to (go to) Kevalrambhai. I saw him
accordingly. There I had not a satisfactory chat. He no doubt
approved of my object but said: “You will have to spend there at least
Rs* 10, 000*” This was a great blow to me, and again he said: “You
will have to set aside all your religious prejudices, if any. You will
have to eat meat, you must drink. You cannot live without that. The
more you spend, the cleverer you will be. It is a very important thing.
I speak to you frankly. Don’t be offended; but, look here, you are
still very young. There are many temptations in London. You are apt
to be entrapped by them.” I was partially dejected by this talk. But I
am not a man who would, after having formed any intention, leave it
easily. He illustrated his statement by giving example of Mr* Gulam
Mahomed Munshi. I asked him whether he could help me in any way
in getting the scholarship. He answered in the negative. He said he
would very gladly do anything except that. I told everything to my
brother.
Then I was entrusted with the business of receiving the consent
of my dear mother, which I thought was not an arduous task for me.
After a day or two, my brother and I went to see Mr* Kevalram; there
he saw us though he was very busy at that time. We had a talk of the
similar kind that I had with him a day or two earlier. He advised my
brother to send me to Porbandar. The proposal was agreed to. Then
we returned. I began to introduce the subject to my mother in joke.
The joke was turned to reality in no time. Then a day was fixed for
my going to Porbandar.
Twice or thrice I prepared to go, but some difficulty came in my
way. Once I was to go with Zaverchand, but an hour before the time
of my departure a serious accident took place. I was always
quarrelling with my friend Sheikh Mehtab
1* On the day of departure I
was quite engrossed in thinking about the quarrel. He had a musical
party at night. I did not enjoy it very well. At about 10*30 p.m. the
party ended and we all went to see Meghjibhai and Rami. On our way
I was buried in the madcap thoughts of London on one side and the
thoughts of Sheikh Mehtab on the other. Amidst thoughts, I came
unconsciously in contact with a carriage. I received some injury. Yet I
did not take the help of anybody  in walking. I think I was quite
dizzy. Then we entered the house of Meghjibhai. There I again came

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 3, 1, 36, 8291) the party ended and we all went to see Meghjibhai and Rami.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 3, 1, 37, 8351) On our way I was buried in the madcap thoughts of London on one side and the thoughts of Sheikh Mehtab on the other.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 3, 1, 38, 8468) Amidst thoughts, I came unconsciously in contact with a carriage.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 3, 1, 39, 8534) I received some injury.

senseless. From that [time] I did not know what took place, and after
that, I am told by them, I fell flat on the ground after some steps. I was
not myself for 5 minutes. They considered I was dead. But fortunately
for myself the ground on which I fell was quite smooth. I came to my
senses at last and all of them were quite joyful. The mother was sent
for. She was very sorry for me, and this caused my delay though I
told them that I was quite well. But none would allow me to go,
though I afterwards came to know that my bold and dearest mother
would have allowed me to go. But she feared the calumny of other
people. At last with great difficulty I was allowed to leave Rajkot for
Porbandar after some days. On my way too I had to encounter some
difficulties.
At length I reached Porbandar to the joy of all. Lalbhai
1 and
Karsondas
2 had come to the Khadi bridge to fetch me home. Now
what had I to do in Porbandar [was to] exact consent from my uncle,
and, secondly apply to Mr* Lely
3 to render me some pecuniary help,
and last, in case of failure to get the State scholarship, to ask
Parmanandbhai
4 to give me some money. The first thing I did was that
I saw uncle and asked him whether he liked my going to London or
not. Then, naturally, as I had expected, he asked me to enumerate the
advantages of going to London. This I did according to my power.
Then he said : “Of course, the people of this generation would like it
very much, but, as for myself, I do not like it. Nevertheless we shall
consider afterwards.” I was not disappointed by such an answer. At
least I had the satisfaction to know that at all events he liked it
inwardly and his deed proved what I thought right.
Unfortunately for me, Mr* Lely was not in Porbandar. It is quite
true that misfortunes never come single. After his return from the
district where he had gone, he was to go at once on leave. My uncle
advised me to wait for him till the next Sunday. And if he did not
come up during that time, he said, he would send me where he should
be. But it gives me much pleasure to write here that he returned from
the district on Sunday. Then it was settled that I should see him           
on Monday. It was done accordingly.  For the first time in my life  I
had an interview with an English gentleman. Formerly I never dared  
to front them. But thoughts of London made me bold. I had small

New Para:  talk with him in Gujarati. He was quite in a hurry. He saw me when he
was ascending the ladder of the upper storey of his bungalow. He said
the Porbandar State was very poor and could not give me any
pecuniary help. However, he said, I should first graduate in India and
then he would see if he could render me any help. Indeed such an
answer from him quite disappointed me. I did not expect such a reply
from him.
Now what I had to do was to ask Parmanandbhai to give me Rs*
5,000* He said he would very gladly give them if my uncle approved
of my going to London. I thought this to be rather a difficult task, yet
I was determined upon exacting his consent. I saw him when he was
busy doing something, and addressed him thus : “Uncle, now tell me
what you really think of my going. My chief aim in coming here is to
exact your consent.” Then he replied : “I cannot approve of it.
Don’t you know that I am going on a pilgrimage, and is it not
disgraceful on my part to say that I like that people should go to
London? However, if your mother and brother like it, I do not at all
object to it.” “But then,” I said, “you don’t know that you prevent
Parmanandbhai from rendering me pecuniary help by refusing to
allow my going to London.” Just as I uttered these words, he said in
an angry tone: “Is it so? My dear chap, you don’t know why he says
so. He knows that I will never approve of your going and so he brings
forth this excuse. But the real thing is that he is never to render you
any help of the kind. I do not prevent him from doing so.” Thus
ended our talk. Then I gaily ran off and saw Parmanandbhai and
word by word related what took place between my uncle and myself.
He too was quite angry when he heard this and at the same time made
a promise to give me Rs* 5,000* I was quite overjoyed when he made a
promise, and what pleased me more was that he swore by his son. Now
from that day I began to think that I would surely go to London.
Then I stayed some days in Porbandar and the more I stayed there the
more I was assured of the promise.
Now here is what took place at Rajkot during my absence. My
friend Sheikh Mehtab who, I should say, is very full of tricks,
reminded Meghjibhai of his promise and forged a letter with my
signature in which he wrote that I stood in need of Rs* 5,000 and so
on. The letter was shown to him and it actually passed for a letter
written by me. Then, of course, he was quite puffed up and made a
solemn promise of giving me Rs* 5,000* I was not informed of this
until I reached Rajkot.

New Para:  Now to return again to Porbandar. At length a day was fixed for
my departure and I bade farewell to my family members and was set
off for Rajkot, with my brother Karsondas and Meghji’s father, really
an incarnation of miserliness. Before going to Rajkot, I went to
Bhavnagar to sell off my furniture, and discontinue the rent of the
house. I did it only in one day and was separated from the friends in
the neighbourhood, not without tears from them and my kind
landlady. I should never forget their kindness and that of Anopram
and others. Having done this, I reached Rajkot.
But I was to see Colonel Watson
1 before my departure for three
years. He was to come to Rajkot on the 19th June, 1888* Indeed it was
a long time for me because I reached Rajkot in the beginning of May.
But I could not help. My brother entertained very high hopes of
Colonel Watson. These days were indeed hard days. I could not sleep
well at night, was always attacked by dreams. Some persons dissuaded
me from going to London and some advised me to do so. Sometimes
my mother too asked me not to go, and what was very strange that not
infrequently my brother also changed his mind. So I was held in
suspense. But, as all of them knew that I should not leave off anything
having first begun it, they were silent. During the time, I was asked by
my brother to sound the mind of Meghjibhai about his promise. The
result was quite disappointing, of course, and from that time he always
acted the part of an enemy. He spoke ill of me before anybody and
everybody. But I was quite able to disregard his taunts. My dearest
mother was quite angry with him for this and sometimes uneasy. But I
could easily console her, and I have the satisfaction to see that I have
very often consoled her with success and have made her laugh heartily
when she, my dear, dear mother, should be shedding tears on my
account. At last Colonel Watson came. I saw him. He said: “I shall
think about it”, but I never got any help from him. I am sorry to say
that it was with difficulty that I could take a trivial note of introduction
which, he said in a peremptory voice, was worth one lac of rupees.
Now really it makes me laugh.
Then a day was fixed for my departure. At first it was the fourth
of August. The matter was now brought to a crisis. The fact I was to
go to England went through the Press. My brother was always asked             
by some persons about my going. Now was the time when he told me
to leave off the intention of going, but I would not do that. Then he

1 of Rajkot and requested him to render
me some pecuniary help. But no help was obtained therefrom. Then
for the last time I saw Thakoresaheb and Colonel Watson. I received a
note of introduction from the latter and a photo from the former.
Here I must write that the fulsome flattery which I had to practise
about this time had quite made me angry. Had it not been for my
credulous and dearest brother, I would never have resorted to such a
piece of gross flattery. After all, the 10th August came and my
brother, Sheikh Mehtab, Mr* Nathubhai, Khushalbhai and I started.
I left Rajkot for Bombay. It was Friday night. I was given an
address by my school fellows. I was quite uneasy when I rose up to
answer the address.
2 When I spoke half of what I had to speak, I began
to shake. I hope I will not do it again when I return to India. Before
proceeding further I must write. Many had come to bid me farewell
on the night. Messrs Kevalram, Chhaganlal (Patwari), Vrajlal,
Harishankar, Amolakh, Manekchand, Latib, Popat, Bhanji, Khimji,
Ramji, Damodar, Meghji, Ramji Kalidas, Naranji, Ranchhoddas,
Manilal were among those who came to did farewell. Jatashankar
Vishvanath and others may be added. The first station was Gondal.
There we saw Dr* Bhau and took Kapurbhai with us. Nathubhai came
as far as Jetpur. At Dhola, Usmanbhai met us and he came as far as
Wadhwan. At Dhola, Messrs Narandas, Pranshankar, Narbheram,
Anandrai and Vrajlal had come to bid farewell.
Twenty-first was the day on which I was to leave Bombay. But
the difficulties which I had to withstand in Bombay are indescribable.
My caste fellows tried their best to prevent me from proceeding
further. Almost all of them were in opposition. And at length my
brother Khushalbhai and Patwari himself advised me not to go. But I
wouldn’t give heed to their advice. Then the sea weather was the
excuse which delayed my proceeding. My brother and others then left
me. But on a sudden I left Bombay on the 4th September 1888* At
this time I was very much obliged to Messrs Jagmohandas,
Damodardas and Bechardas. To Shamalji, of course, I owe immense
obligation, and what I owe  to Ranchhodlal

something more than obligation. Messrs Jagmohandas, Manshankar,

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 2, 16603) saw H. H. the Thakoresaheb 1 of Rajkot and requested him to render me some pecuniary help.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 3, 16694) But no help was obtained therefrom.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 4, 16730) Then for the last time I saw Thakoresaheb and Colonel Watson.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 5, 16792) I received a note of introduction from the latter and a photo from the former.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 6, 16871) Here I must write that the fulsome flattery which I had to practise about this time had quite made me angry.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 7, 16980) Had it not been for my credulous and dearest brother, I would never have resorted to such a piece of gross flattery.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 8, 17097) After all, the 10th August came and my brother, Sheikh Mehtab, Mr. Nathubhai, Khushalbhai and I started.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 9, 17202) I left Rajkot for Bombay.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 13, 17351) 2 When I spoke half of what I had to speak, I began to shake.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 14, 17413) I hope I will not do it again when I return to India.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 15, 17467) Before proceeding further I must write.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 16, 17507) Many had come to bid me farewell on the night.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 17, 17554) Messrs Kevalram, Chhaganlal (Patwari), Vrajlal, Harishankar, Amolakh, Manekchand, Latib, Popat, Bhanji, Khimji, Ramji, Damodar, Meghji, Ramji Kalidas, Naranji, Ranchhoddas, Manilal were among those who came to did farewell.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 18, 17778) Jatashankar Vishvanath and others may be added.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 19, 17826) The first station was Gondal.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 20, 17856) There we saw Dr. Bhau and took Kapurbhai with us.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 21, 17906) Nathubhai came as far as Jetpur.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 22, 17939) At Dhola, Usmanbhai met us and he came as far as Wadhwan.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 7, 1, 23, 17997) At Dhola, Messrs Narandas, Pranshankar, Narbheram, Anandrai and Vrajlal had come to bid farewell.

New Para:  The sea voyage. It was about 5 p.m. when the ship weighed
anchor. I was very anxious about the voyage but fortunately it agreed
with me. Throughout the voyage I was not at all sea-sick and I had no
vomiting. It was for the first time in my life that I sailed in a
steamship. I enjoyed the voyage very much. At about 6 o’clock the
dinner bell was rung. The steward asked me to go to the table. But I
did not go and ate what I had brought with me. I was very much
surprised at the liberty which Mr* Mazmudar took with me on the first
night. He spoke to me in such a manner as if we were very old
acquaintances. He had no black coat. So I gave him mine for dinner.
He went to the table. From that night I liked him very much. He
entrusted his keys to me, and I began to look upon him as my elder
brother from that very night. There was one Maratha doctor with us as
far as Aden. He, on the whole, looked like a good man. Thus for two
days I lived upon the sweetmeat and fruits which I had on board with
me. Then Mr* Mazmudar made an agreement with some boys on
board to cook us food. I would never have been able to make such an
agreement. There was one Abdul Majid who was a first-class
passenger while we were saloon passengers. We enjoyed our dinner
cooked by the boy.
Now something about the steamship. I liked the arrangements of
the steamer very much. When we sit in the cabins or saloon, we forget
that the cabins and the saloons are a part of the ship. We sometimes do
not feel the motion at all. The dexterity of the workmen and the
sailors was indeed admirable. There were musical instruments in the
steamer. I every now and then played upon the piano. There were
cards,  chessboard and draughts on the board. The European
passengers always played some games at night. The decks are a great
relief to the passengers. You are generally tired of sitting in the

the fellow-passengers if you are bold and have got that stuff. The
scene of the sea when the sky is clear is lovely. On one moonlight
night I was watching the sea. I could see the moon reflected in the
water. On account of the waves, the moon appeared as if she were
moving  here and there. One dark night when the sky was clear the
stars were reflected in the water. The scene around us was very
beautiful at that time. I could not at first imagine what that was. They
appeared like so many diamonds. But I knew that a diamond could
not float. Then I thought that they must be some insects which can
only be seen at night. Amidst these reflections I looked at the sky and
at once found that it was nothing but stars reflected in waters. I
laughed at my folly. This reflection of the stars gives us the idea of
fireworks. Fancy yourself to be standing on the storey of a bungalow
watching the fireworks performed before you. I very often enjoyed
this scene.
For some days I did not speak a word to the fellow-passengers. I
always got up at 8 a.m. in the morning, washed my teeth, then went to
the w.c. and took my bath. The arrangement of the English water
closets astonished a native passenger. We do not get there water and
are obliged to use pieces of paper.
After enjoying the sea voyage for about five days, we reached
Aden. During these days not a single piece of land or a mountain was
seen by us. All of us were tired of the monotony of the voyage and
were eager to see land. At last on the morning of the 6th day we saw
land. All looked gay and cheerful. At about 11 a.m. we anchored at
Aden. Some boys came with small boats. They were great swimmers.
Some Europeans threw some money in the waters. They went deep
into the waters and found out the money. I wish I could do so. This
was a pretty sight. We, after enjoying this sight for about half an hour,
went to see Aden. I must say here that we simply saw the boys finding
out the pieces. Ourselves did not throw a single pie. From this day we
began to experience the idea of expenses of England. We were three
persons and had to pay two rupees for boat hire. The coast was hardly
at a mile’s distance. We reached the coast in 15 minutes. Then we
hired a carriage. We intended to go to see the waterworks which are
the only object of interest in Aden. But, unfortunately, the time being
up we could not go there. We saw the Camp of Aden. It was good; the
buildings were good. They were generally shops. The construction of
the buildings was most probably like that of the bungalows in Rajkot
and especially the new bungalow of the Political Agent. I could not

the tanks are the only place for fresh water. The heat of the sun was
excessive. I was quite wet with perspiration. This was because we were
not far from the Red Sea. What astonished me more was that I saw not
a single tree or a green plant. Men rode on mules or asses. We could
hire mules if we liked. The camp is situated on the hill. I heard from
the boatman, when we returned, that the boys of whom I wrote above
are sometimes injured. The legs of some and arms of others are cut
off by sea animals. But still the boys, being very poor, sat each in their
small boats in which we dare not sit. Each of us had to pay one rupee
for the carriage fare. The anchor was weighed at 12 a.m. and we left
Aden. But from this day we always saw some land.
In the evening we entered the Red Sea. We began to feel the
heat. But I don’t think it was so scorching, as is described by some in
Bombay. Indeed it was unbearable in the cabins. You cannot expose
yourself to the sun. You will not like to stay even for a few minutes in
your cabin. But if you are on the deck you are sure to receive pleasant
gales of fresh air. At least I did so. Almost all the passengers slept on
the deck and so did I* The heat of the new morning sun, too, you
cannot bear. You are always safe when you are on the deck. This heat
we generally get for three days. Then we entered the Suez on the
fourth night. We could see the lamps in the Suez from a great
distance. The Red Sea was sometimes broad and sometimes quite
narrow. So narrow that we can see the land on both the sides. Before
entering the Suez Canal we passed the Hellsgate. Hellsgate is a strip of
water very narrow, bound on both the sides by hills. It is so called
because many ships are wrecked at that place. We saw the wreck of a
ship in the Red Sea. We stayed at Suez for about half an hour. Now it
was said that we shall receive cold. Some said that you will require
liquor after leaving Aden. But it was false. Now I had begun to talk a
little with the fellow-passengers. They said, after leaving Aden you will
require meat:  but it was not so. For the first time in my life I saw the
electric light in the front of our ship. It appeared like moonlight. The
front part of the ship appeared very beautiful. I think it must appear
more beautiful to a man seeing it, placed on some other place, just as
we cannot enjoy the beauty of our person as others, i.e., we cannot see
it to advantage. The construction of the Suez Canal I am not able to
understand. It is indeed marvellous. I cannot think of the genius of a
man who invented it. I don’t know how he would have done it. It is
quite right to say that he has competed with nature. It is not an easy

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 3, 24515) I am afraid that perhaps the tanks are the only place for fresh water.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 4, 24586) The heat of the sun was excessive.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 5, 24621) I was quite wet with perspiration.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 6, 24656) This was because we were not far from the Red Sea.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 7, 24707) What astonished me more was that I saw not a single tree or a green plant.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 8, 24782) Men rode on mules or asses.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 9, 24810) We could hire mules if we liked.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 10, 24843) The camp is situated on the hill.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 11, 24877) I heard from the boatman, when we returned, that the boys of whom I wrote above are sometimes injured.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 12, 24980) The legs of some and arms of others are cut off by sea animals.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 13, 25044) But still the boys, being very poor, sat each in their small boats in which we dare not sit.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 14, 25137) Each of us had to pay one rupee for the carriage fare.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 15, 25192) The anchor was weighed at 12 a.m.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 16, 25226) and we left Aden.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 17, 25244) But from this day we always saw some land.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 18, 25287) In the evening we entered the Red Sea.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 10, 1, 19, 25326) We began to feel the heat.

New Para:  task to join two seas. Only one ship can pass through the Canal at a
time. It requires skilful pilotship. The ship sails at a very low motion.
We cannot feel its motion. The water of the Canal is quite dirty. I
forget its depth. It is as broad as the Aji
1 at Ramnath. You can see men
passing by on both the sides. The part near the Canal is barren. The
Canal belongs to the French. Another pilot comes from Ismailia to
direct the ship. The French take a certain sum of money for every
ship that passes through the Canal. The income must be very large.
Besides the electric lamp in the ship, there are seen lights at a distance
of some 20 feet on both sides. These are the lights of different
colours. The ship has to pass these rows of lights. It takes about 24
hours to pass through the Canal. The beauty of the scene is beyond
my power to describe. You cannot enjoy it unless you see it. Port Said
is the terminus of the Canal. Port Said owes its existence to the Suez
Canal. We anchored at Port Said in the evening. The ship was to stay
there for an hour, but one hour was quite sufficient to see Port Said.
Now the currency was English. Indian money is quite useless here.
The boat-fare is six pence each. A penny is worth one anna. The
construction of the Port Said building is French. Here we get an idea
of the French life. There we saw some coffee restaurants. At the first I
thought it was a theatre. But it was nothing but a coffee house. [On]
one side we drink coffee or soda or tea or any drink, and on the other
we hear music. Some women are playing fiddle bands. A bottle of
lemonade in these cafes, as they are called, will cost you 12 pence,
which we get for less than a penny in Bombay. Customers are said to
hear music gratis. But really it is not so. As soon as the music is
finished, a woman, with a plate covered with a handkerchief in her
hand comes before every customer. That means that you give her
something and we are obliged to give something. We visited the cafe
and gave 6 pence to the woman. Port Said is nothing but a seat of
luxury. There women and men are very cunning. The interpreter will
follow to guide you. But you boldly tell him that you do not want
him. Port Said is hardly as big as the proper para
2 of Rajkot. We left
Port Said at 7 p.m.
 Among our fellow-passengers one Mr* Jeffreys was very kind
to me. He always told me to go to the table, and take something there,

New Para:  but it was not so. After 3 days we reached Brindisi at night. The
harbour of Brindisi is beautiful. The steamer just touches the coast
and you descend to the coast by means of a ladder provided there. It
being [dark] I could not see Brindisi much. There everyone speaks
Italian. Roads of Brindisi are paved with stones. The streets are
sloping. They too are paved. Gas is used for lamps. We saw the station
of Brindisi. It was not so beautiful as the stations of the B* B* & C* I*
Rly. But the railway carriages were far bigger than ours. The traffic
was good. When you land at Brindisi, a man would come and ask you,
in case you are a black man: “Sir, there is a beautiful girl of 14,
follow me, Sir, and I will take you there, the charge is not high, Sir.”
You are at once puzzled. But be calm and answer boldly that you
don’t want her and tell the man to go away and thereby you will be
safe. If you are in any difficulty at once refer to a policeman just near
you, or at once enter a large building which you will surely see. But
before you enter it, read the name on the building and make sure that
it is open to all. Thus you will be safe.  This you will be able to make
out at once. Tell the porter there that you are in a difficulty, and he
will at once show you what you should do. If you are bold enough,
ask the porter to take you to the Chief Officer and you will refer the
matter to him. By a large building I mean that it must be belonging to
Thomas Cook or Henry King or some such other agents. They will
take care of you. Don’t be miserly at that time. Pay the porter some-
thing. But this means is to be resorted to when you think yourself to
be in any danger. But these buildings you will only see on the coasts.
If you are far away from the coast you are to find out a policeman
and in case of failure, your conscience is the best dictator. We left
Brindisi early in the morning.
After about 3 days we reached Malta. The ship anchored at
about 2 p.m. She was to stay there for nearly four hours. Mr* Abdul
Majid was to come with us. But somehow or other he was very late. I
was quite impatient to go. Mr* Mazmudar said: “Shall we go alone
and not wait for Mr* Majid?” I said: “Just as you please. I have no
objection.” Then, of course, we went alone. On our return Abdul
Majid saw us and said he was very sorry that we went away. Then Mr*
Mazumdar said: “It was Gandhi who was impatient and told me not to
wait for you.” I was really very much offended by such behaviour of
Mr* Mazmudar. I did not try to wash off the charge but silently
accepted it. But I know that the charge would have been washed off,
had I only hinted to Abdul Majid: “Had Mr* Mazmudar really wanted
to wait for you, he had better not act according to what I said.” And I

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 12, 1, 34, 31790) She was to stay there for nearly four hours.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 12, 1, 35, 31835) Mr. Abdul Majid was to come with us.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 12, 1, 36, 31872) But somehow or other he was very late.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 12, 1, 37, 31911) I was quite impatient to go.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 12, 1, 38, 31940) Mr. Mazmudar said: “Shall we go alone and not wait for Mr. Majid?” I said: “Just as you please.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 12, 1, 39, 32036) I have no objection.” Then, of course, we went alone.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 12, 1, 40, 32090) On our return Abdul Majid saw us and said he was very sorry that we went away.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 12, 1, 41, 32169) Then Mr. Mazumdar said: “It was Gandhi who was impatient and told me not to wait for you.” I was really very much offended by such behaviour of Mr. Mazmudar.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 12, 1, 42, 32327) I did not try to wash off the charge but silently accepted it.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 12, 1, 43, 32390) But I know that the charge would have been washed off, had I only hinted to Abdul Majid: “Had Mr. Mazmudar really wanted to wait for you, he had better not act according to what I said.” And I

Majid of my having no hand in the doing. But at that time I did not
mean to do anything of the kind. But from that day I began to
entertain very low opinion about Mr* Mazmudar, and from that day I
had no real respect for him. Besides there happened two or three
things which made me like Mazmudar the less day by day.
Malta is an object of interest. There are many things to see. But
the time at our disposal was not sufficient. As I said before, Mr*
Mazmudar and myself went to the coast. Here we had received a great
rogue. We had to suffer a great loss. We took the number of the boat,
and to see the city we hired a carriage. The rogue was with us. After
driving for about half an hour, we reached St* Juan Church. The
church was beautifully built. There we saw some skeletons of eminent
persons. They were very old. We gave a shilling to the friend who
showed us over the church. Just opposite the church was a statue of St*
Juan. Thence drove to the city. The roads were paved. On both sides
of the pavement were paved walks for men. The island is very
beautiful. There are many grand buildings. Went to see the Armoury
Hall. This hall was beautifully decorated. There we saw very old
paintings. They were not really paintings but embroidered in. But a
stranger would not perceive that it was embroidered work unless told
by somebody. In the hall were the arms of old warriors. All of them
[were] worth seeing. Having no record, I do not remember them all.
There was a helmet which was 30 lb. in weight. The carriage of
Napoleon Bonaparte was very beautiful. Having given a tip of 6d. to
the man who showed us over the hall we returned. We were obliged to
take off our hats when we saw the church and the Armoury Hall, as a
token of respect. Then we went to the shop of the rogue. He tried to
force something upon us. But we wouldn’t buy anything. At length
Mr* Mazmudar bought the views of Malta for 2/6* Here the rogue
gave us an interpreter and himself did not come with us. The
interpreter was a very good man. He drove us to the orange gardens.
We saw the gardens. I did not like the gardens at all. I like our public
park of Rajkot better than the gardens. If there was anything worth
seeing for me, it was the golden and red fishes in a small enclosure of
water. Thence we returned to the town, went to a hotel. Mr* Mazmudar
took  some potatoes and tea. On our way we met an Indian. Mr*
Mazmudar being a very bold man spoke to the Indian. On further talk
with him it was understood that he was the brother of a man who had a
shop in Malta. We at once went to the shop. Mr* Mazmudar had a

New Para:  good chat with the shopkeeper. We made some purchases there and
spent two hours in the  shop. So we could not see much of Malta. We
saw another church. That too was very beautiful and worth seeing. We
had to see the opera house but we had no time to do that. We took
leave of the gentleman who gave Mr* Mazmudar his card to his
brother in London. On our return, the rogue again met us and came
with us at 6 p.m. We reached the coast and paid the rogue, the good
interpreter and the carriageman. We had a quarrel about the fare with
the boat-man. The result was, of course, in favour of the boatman.
Here we were cheated a good deal.
The steamer Clyde left at 7 p.m. After 3 days’ voyage we
reached Gibraltar at 12 p.m. The ship remained there the whole night.
I had a good mind to see Gibraltar, so got up early in the morning
and awakened Mazmudar and asked him whether he would come with
me to the shore or not. He said he would. Then I went to Mr* Majid
and awoke him. We three went to the shore. The time at our disposal
was only 11/2 hours. It being the dawn of the day all the shops were
shut. It is said that Gibraltar being a free port smoking is very cheap.
Gibraltar is built upon a rock. On the top is the fortification which to
our great sorrow we could not see. The houses are in rows. In order to
go from the first row to the second, we are obliged to ascend certain
steps. I liked it very much. The construction was beautiful. Roads were
paved. Having no time we were soon obliged to return. The ship
weighed anchor at 8*30 a.m.
In three days we reached Plymouth at 11 p.m. Now was the
proper time for cold. Each and every passenger said that we would die
without meat and drink but nothing of the kind happened to us.
Indeed it was pretty well cold. We were also told about the storm but
could not see the storm. Really I was very anxious to see it but could
not. It being night we could see nothing of Plymouth. We had dense
fog there. At length the ship left for London. In 24 hours we reached
London; left the steamer and reached Victoria Hotel via Tilbury

not take care of the luggage too, and as if he had been in London for

splendour of the hotel. I had never in my life seen such pomp. My
business was simply to follow the two friends in silence. There were
electric lights all over. We were admitted into a room. There Mr*

choose second floor or not. Mr* Majid thinking it below his dignity to
inquire about the daily rent said yes. The manager at once gave us a
bill of 6s. each per day and a boy was sent with us. I was all the while
smiling within myself. Then we were to go to the second floor by a
lift. I did not know what it was. The boy at once touched something

New Para:  DEAR SIR,
You will know me by looking at the note which, you said, when
I had the opportunity of seeing you, you would preserve.
At that time I had requested you to render to me some
pecuniary aid as a means to enable me to proceed to England; but
unfortunately you were in a hurry to leave; so I had not the sufficient
time to say all that I had to say.
I was at that time very impatient to proceed to England. So I
left  India on the 4th of September, 1888, with what little money I had
at that time. What my father left for us three brothers was indeed very
little. However, trusting that nearly £666, which was all my brother
could with great difficulty spare for me, would be sufficient  for my
three years’ stay in London. I left India for receiving legal education
in England. I knew while in India that education and living in London
were very expensive.  But now from two months’ experience in

New Para:  DEAR SIR,
It is about six or seven  weeks since I landed in this country. By
this time, I am comfortably settled and have fairly begun my studies. I
have joined the Inner Temple for my legal course.
You are well aware that English life is very expensive and, from
what little experience I have had of it, I find that it is more so than I
could persuade myself to believe while I was in India. My means as
you know are very limited. I don't think I can go through a course of
three years satisfactorily without some extraneous help. When I
remember that you took a great deal of interest in my father and had
extended your hand of friendship to him, I have very little doubt that
you will take the same interest in what concerns him and I feel
confident that you will try your best to procure me some substantial
help which would facilitate my course of study in this country. You
will thus confer a great and much-needed obligation upon me.
I saw Dr* Butler a few days ago. He is very kind to me and has
promised to give me all assistance he can.
The weather so far has not been very severe. I am doing very
well.
With best respects,
          I beg to remain,
       
 Dear Sir,
Yours faithfully,

New Para:  Indian matters, is that all the Indians are born vegetarians. Now this is
true only in part. Indian people are divided into three main divisions,
viz., the Hindus, the Mohammedans, and the Parsis.
The Hindus are again divided into four chief castes, viz., the
Brahmins, the Kshatriyas, the Vaisyas, and the Sudras, Of all these, in
theory, only the Brahmins and the Vaisyas are pure vegetarians. But in
practice almost all the Indians are vegetarians. Some are so
voluntarily, and others compulsorily. The latter, though always willing
to take, are yet too poor to buy meat. This statement will be borne out
by the fact that there are thousands in India who have to live on one
pice (11/3d.) a day. These live on bread and salt, a heavily taxed article;
for even in a poverty-stricken country like India, it will be very
difficult,if not utterly impossible,to get eatable flesh-meat for 11/3d.

New Para:  The question who are vegetarians in India being disposed of, the
natural question will be what is vegetarianism as practised by them?
To begin with, Indian vegetarianism does not mean the V.E.M*
1 diet.
The Indians, i.e., the Indian vegetarians, decline to take, besides fish,
flesh and fowl, eggs, for they argue that to eat an egg is equivalent to
killing life; since an egg, if left undisturbed would, prima facie,
become a fowl. But, unlike some of the vegetarian extremists here,
they not only do not abstain from milk and butter, but consider them
sacred enough to be used on what are called “fruit-days”, which
occur every fortnight, and which are generally observed by the high-
caste Hindus; because, as they put it, they do not kill the cow in taking
milk from her. And certainly the milking of a cow, which, by the way,
has been the subject of painting and poetry cannot shock the most
delicate feelings as would the slaughtering of her. It may be worth
mentioning en passant that the cow is an object of worship among the
Hindus, and a movement set on foot to prevent the cows from being
shipped off for the purposes of slaughter is progressing rapidly.

New Para:  All the 
Indians 
generally—and 
the 
grown-up 
persons
particularly, and among them the high-caste Hindus—take two meals
a day with a glass or two of water between the meals whenever they
feel thirsty. The first meal they take at about 10 a.m., which would
correspond to the English dinner, and the second meal at about 8
p.m., which would correspond to supper so far as the name goes,
though in reality, it is a substantial meal. From the above it will have
been seen that there is no breakfast—which, seeing that the Indians
generally rise at 6 o'clock, and even as early as four or five o'clock in
the morning, they would seem to require—nor the ordinary midday
meal. Some of the readers will no doubt wonder how the Indians go
about without anything to eat for nine hours after their first meal. This
may be explained in two ways, viz., first, the habit is second nature.
Their religion commands some, and employment or custom compels
others, to take not more than two meals in one day. Secondly, the
climate of India, which except in some parts is very hot, will account
for the habit. For even in England, it appears that the same quantity of
food is not required in summer as in winter. Unlike the English, the
Indians do not take each dish separately, but they mix many things
together. Among some of the Hindus it is one of the requirements of
their religion to mix all their food together. Moreover, every dish is
elaborately prepared. In fact they don't believe in plain boiled
vegetables, but must have them flavoured with plenty of condiments,
e.g., pepper, salt, cloves, turmeric, mustard seed, and various other
things for which it would be difficult to find English names unless
they be those used in medicine.
The first meal consists generally of bread or rather cakes—of
which more hereafter—some pulse, e.g., peas, haricot beans, etc., and
two or three green vegetables cooked together, or separately, followed
by rice and pulse cooked in water, and flavoured with various spices.
After this, some take milk and rice, or simply milk, or curdled milk, or
even whey, especially in summer.
The second meal, i.e., the supper, consists of much the same
things as the first one, but the quantity is less and the vegetables fewer
at this meal. Milk is more liberally used at this meal. The readershould
be reminded that this is not the food that the Indians invariably use
nor should he think that the above will be the typical dishes all over
India and among all classes. Thus, for example, no sweets are
mentioned in the specimen meals while they are sure to be used
among the well-to-do classes at least once a week. Moreover, while, as

New Para:  said above, wheat preponderates over rice in the Bombay Presidency,
in Bengal rice gets the better of wheat. So also with regard to the third
exception which must prove the rule, the food among the labouring
class is different from what is given above. To mention all the varieties
would be the fill up volumes and to do so would, it is to be feared,
divest the article of all interest.
Butter, or if you please, clarified butter, is much more used for
culinary purposes than in England or, it may be, even in Europe. And
according to a doctor of some authority, if it would do no good, much
use of better, in a hot climate like that of India would do no harm
such as it might do in a cold climate like that of England.
It will perhaps strike the reader that the fruit, yes, the all-
important fruit, is sadly conspicuous by its absence in the above-
mentioned specimen dishes. Some, among many of the reasons, are
that the Indians do not know the proper value of fruit, that the poor
people cannot afford to buy good fruit, and that good fruit is not
available all over India, except in large cities. Indeed, there are certain
fruits, not to be found here, which are used by all classes in India; but
alas, these are used as superficial things, not as food, and no one
knows their value chemically, because no one takes the trouble to
analyse them.

first ground in a handmill—a simple contrivance to reduce the wheat
to powder-not a mill requiring machinery. This powdered wheat is
passed through a sieve with large holes, so that the coarsest bran is left
out. Indeed, among the poor classes it is not passed through the sieve
at all. Thus the flour, though not the same as that used by the
vegetarians here, is far superior to the ordinary flour that is used here
for the much-abused white bread. Some clarified butter, i.e., butter
boiled and passed through a sieve-sometimes a useless process when
the butter is quite pure-and then allowed to become cool-say a tea-

bake one cake. This cake is eaten while hot with butter, and has a very
nice flavour. It may be, and is, eaten even quite cold. What meat is to
the ordinary Englishman, the cake is to the Indian, be he a vegetarian
or a meat-eater, for in India a meat-eater does not, in the writer's
opinion, regard his meat as an absolute necessity, but takes it rather as
a side dish to help him, so to speak, in eating the cakes.
Such in outline, and only in outline, is the ordinary food of a
well-to-do Indian vegetarian. Now a question may be asked, “Has not
the British Rule effected any change in the habits of the Indian
people?” So far as the food and drink are concerned “yes”, and
“no”. No, because ordinary men and women have stuck to their
original food and the number of meals. Yes, because those who have
learnt a little bit of English have picked up English ideas here and
there, but this change too—whether it is for the worse or for the better
must be left to the reader to judge—is not very perceptible.
The last-mentioned class have begun to believe in breakfast,
which usually consists of a cup or two of tea. Now this brings us to the
question of drink. The drinking of tea and coffee by the so-called
educated Indians, chiefly due to the British Rule, may be passed over
with the briefest notice. The most that tea and coffee can do is to
cause a little extra expense, and general debility of health when
indulged in to excess, but one of the most greatly-felt evils of the
British Rule is the importation of alcohol—that enemy of mankind,
that curse of civilization—in some form or another. The measure of
the evil wrought by this borrowed habit will be properly gauged by
the reader when he is told that the enemy has spread throughout the
length and breadth of India, in spite of the religious prohibition; for
even the touch of a bottle containing alcohol pollutes the
Mohammedan, according to his religion, and the religion of the
Hindu strictly prohibits the use of alcohol in any form whatever, and
yet, alas! the Government, it seems, instead of stopping, are aiding and
abetting the spread of alcohol. The poor there, as everywhere, are the
greatest sufferers. It is they who spend what little they earn in buying
alcohol instead of buying food and other necessities. It is that
wretched poor man who has to starve his family, who has to break the
sacred trust of  looking after his children, if any, in order to drink
himself into misery and premature death. Here be it said to the credit
of Mr* Caine1, the ex-Member for Barrow, that he, undaunted, is still
carrying on his admirable crusade  against the spread of the evil, but

New Para:  After having known who are vegetarians in India, and what they
generally eat, the reader will be able to judge from the following facts
how hollow and baseless are the arguments advanced by some people
regarding the weak constitutions of the vegetarian Hindus.
One thing often said about the Indian vegetarians is that they are
physically very feeble, and that, therefore, vegetarianism is not
compatible with bodily strength.
Now, if it can be proved that generally in India the vegetarians
are as strong as, if not stronger than, the Indian meat-eaters, and for
that matter even Englishmen, and moreover, that where weakness
exists it can be ascribed to many other reasons than that of non-flesh
diet, the whole structure on which the above argument is based falls to
the ground.
It  must at the outset be admitted that the Hindus as a rule are
notoriously weak; but an unbiased person—a meat-eater—who knows
India and her people even superficially will tell you that there are
many other causes incessantly at work to account for the proverbial

New Para:  weakness. One of the most important reasons, if not the most
important one, is the wretched custom of infant marriages and its
attendant evils. Generally, children when they reach the great age of
nine are burdened with the fetters of married life. In many cases they
are married at a still younger age and in some cases they are betrothed
while yet unborn. Thus one woman would promise to marry her child,
if male, to another's if  female, and vice versa. Of course in the two  
latter cases consummation does not take place before they are ten or
eleven years old. Cases are recorded in which a wife of twelve had a
child by a husband of sixteen or seventeen. Will not these marriages
tell upon the strongest constitutions?
Now fancy how weak the progeny of such marriages must be.
Then look at the cares such a couple have to undergo. Suppose a boy
of eleven is married to a girl of about the same age. Thus at a time

He has not actually to maintain her, for in India a son when married
does not necessarily separate from his parents unless he be at sixes
and sevens
1 with them; but he has to do everything short of that. Then
about six years after marriage he has a son, probably he has not yet
finished his studies, and he has to think of earning money not only to
maintain himself but his wife and child, for he cannot expect to pass
his whole life with his father, and even granting that he may, he should
certainly be expected to contribute something towards his wife's and
his child's maintenance. Will not the mere knowledge of his duty prey
upon his mind and thus undermine his health? Can anyone dare to
say that this will not shatter the most robust constitution? But one may
well argue that if that boy, in the above example, had eaten flesh-meat
he would have kept stronger than he did. A reply to such an argument
is to be found from those Kshatriya princes who in spite of their meat
diet are very weak owing to debauchery.
Then the shepherds in India afford a good example of how
strong an Indian vegetarian can be where other opposite agencies are
not at work. An Indian shepherd is a finely built man of Herculean
constitution. He, with his thick, strong cudgel, would be a match for
any ordinary European with his sword. Cases are recorded of
shepherds having killed or driven away tigers and lions with their
cudgels. “But, “said a friend one day, “this is an example of men
living in the rude and natural state. In the present highly artificial state
of society you require something more than mere cabbage and peas.
Your shepherd lacks intelligence, he reads no book, etc. etc”.The one
and only answer to this was, and is, that the vegetarian shepherd would
be equal to, if not more than a match for, a meat-eating shepherd.
Thus there is a comparison between vegetarian of one class and a
meat-eater of the same class. It is a comparison between strength and
strength, and not between strength and strength plus intelligence, for
my attempt for the moment is simply to disprove that Indian
vegetarians are physically weak on account of their vegetarianism.

vegetables in the present state of society, is it conclusively proved that
flesh or meat is that substitute?
Then take the case of the Kshatriyas, the so-called warlike race
in India. They are, of course, meat-eaters and how few of them there
are who have wielded a sword! Far be it from me to say that they as a
race are very weak. So long as Pruthuraj
1 and Bhim
2 and all of their
type—not to go to the older times—are remembered, he will be a fool
who would have it believed that they are a weak race. But now it is a
sad fact that they have degenerated. The truly warlike people, among
others, are the people of the North-Western provinces, known as
Bhayas
3* They subsist on wheat, pulse, and greens. They are the
guardians of peace, they are largely employed in the native armies.
From the above facts it is easy to see that vegetarianism is not
only not injurious, but on the contrary is conducive to bodily strength
and that attributing the Hindu weakness to vegetarianism is simply
based on a fallacy.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 24, 1, 5, 59389) They are, of course, meat-eaters and how few of them there are who have wielded a sword!

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 24, 1, 11, 59993) From the above facts it is easy to see that vegetarianism is not only not injurious, but on the contrary is conducive to bodily strength and that attributing the Hindu weakness to vegetarianism is simply based on a fallacy.

New Para:  some prayers to his God. Then he does his toilet which consists of
washing his mouth and face. I may be allowed here to digress for a
while to acquaint the reader with the brush an Indian uses for his
teeth. The brush is nothing more than a branch of a thorny tree called
babul; one branch is cut up into pieces about a foot long. Of course,
all the thorns are removed. The Indian crushes one end of the stick
between his teeth till it is soft enough to brush his teeth. Thus he
makes for himself every day a new and home-made brush. When he
has well brushed his teeth and made them pearl white he splits the
stick into two, and after bending one part into a curve scrapes his
tongue. This process of brushing probably accounts for the strong
and beautiful teeth of the average Indian. It is perhaps superfluous to
add that he uses no tooth powder. Old persons when their teeth are not
strong enough to crush the stick use a small hammer. The whole
process does not take more than twenty or twenty-five minutes.
To return to the shepherd, he then takes his breakfast consisting
of a thick cake made of millet—an Anglo-Indian name for bajari, a
kind of corn much used in India instead of, or in addition to, wheat—
clarified butter and molasses. At about eight or nine o'clock in the
morning he 
goes to pasture the 
cattle 
placed 
under 
his
superintendence. The place of pasture is generally two or three miles
from his town. It is hilly tract of land studded with a green carpet of
luxuriant foliage. Thus he has the unique advantage of enjoying the
freshestm air with natural scenery thrown in. While the cattle are
roaming about,  he whiles away his time in singing or talking to his
companion who may be his wife, brother or some other relation. At
about twelve o' clock he takes his lunch, which he always carries with
him. It consists of the ever-present cakes, clarified butter, one
vegetable, or some pulse, or instead, or in addition, some pickle and
fresh milk directly taken from the cow. Then at about two or three
o'clock he not infrequently takes a nap for about half an hour under
some shady tree. This short sleep gives him relief from the heat of the
scorching sun. At six he returns home, at seven he has supper, for
which he takes some hot cakes, pulse or vegetables, winds up with rice
and milk, or rice and whey. After doing some household business,
which often means a pleasant chat with the family members, he goes
to bed at ten o'clock. He sleeps either in the open air, or in a hut which
is sometimes overcrowded. He resorts to the hut in winter or in the
rainy season. It may be worthy of remark that these huts, even though

New Para:  The only flaw that can be found in his mode of living is the
paucity of baths. In a hot climate baths are very useful. While a
Brahmin would have his bath twice a day, and a Vaisya once a day, a
shepherd would have only one bath a week. I shall here again digress
to explain the manner in which the Indian takes his baths. Generally,
he has his baths in the river flowing near his town, but if he is too idle
to go to the river, or is afraid of being drowned, or if there is no river
near his town, he has his baths at home. There is no bath into which he
can plunge. He takes water from a large vessel, placed near him, with a
goblet and pours it over his body, because he believes that the
moment you plunge into stagnant water you render it impure and,
therefore, unfit for further use. For the same reason he would not even
wash his hands in a basin, but have someone to pour it over his hands
or do it himself by holding the goblet between his arms.
But to return, the paucity of the baths does not, it seems,
materially affect his health; while it is obvious that if the Brahmin were
to go without his baths even for a day, he would feel very
uncomfortable, and if he were to continue not taking them a little
longer, he would very soon become ill.
This is, I suppose, an instance of many things which, otherwise
inexplicable, can be accounted for by habit. Thus while a scavenger,
in pursuing his employment keeps good health, any ordinary person
trying to do the same will be face to face with death. Death would
soon  be knocking at the door of a delicately nurtured lord trying to

I cannot help here giving a fable or anecdote which is exactly to
the point. A king fell in love with a female tooth brush seller, who was
a very Venus in beauty. As might naturally be expected she was
ordered to be placed in the king's palace. She was, in fact, placed in
the lap of luxury. She had the best food, the best clothes, in short,
everything of the best. And lo! in proportion to the luxury, her health
began to fall. Scores of physicians were in attendance, but all the
drugs most regularly administered proved of no avail. Meanwhile a
shrewd physician found out the real cause of all the illness. He said
that she was possessed by evil  spirits. Therefore, in order to satisfy
them, he ordered some pieces of old cakes to be set, together with fruit
in each of her many rooms. They were to disappear in as many days
as there were rooms, and with them, he said, the illness would
disappear. And it was so. Of course the cakes were consumed by the
poor queen.
Now this shows the mastery that habit gets over men. So I
think the paucity of baths does not greatly harm the shepherd.
The result of this mode of living was partially noticed in the last
article, viz., the vegetarian shepherd is physically strong. He is also
long-lived. I know a shepherdess who was more than one hundred
yeas old in 1888* When I last saw her, her eyesight was very good. Her
memory was fresh. She could recollect things that she had seen in her
childhood. She could walk with a stick to support her. I hope she is
still living. Besides, the shepherd's figure is symmetrical. It is very rare
to see any deformity in him. Without being fierce like a tiger, he is yet
strong and brave and as docile as a lamb. Without being awe-inspiring,
his stature is commanding. Altogether, the Indian shepherd is a very
fine specimen of a vegetarian, and will compare very favourably with
any meat-eater so far as bodily strength goes.

New Para:  Diwali, which may be termed the Hindu Christmas, occurs at the
end of the Hindu year, i.e., during the month of November. It is both
a social and religious holiday. It spreads over nearly a month. The
first day of the month of Ashwin (the twelfth month of the Hindu
year) heralds the approach of the grand festival when the children let
off their first fire-works. The first nine days are called Nava Ratri
(nine nights). These days are chiefly marked by garbis. Some twenty
or thirty, and even more people form themselves into a large circle, in
the centre is placed a huge lamp-post tastefully constructed and
illuminated all round, in the centre also sits a man with his tabors
reciting some popular verses. The people forming the circle repeat the
verses, keeping time to them with claps of hands. While repeating the
verses, they move round the lamp-post, at the same time stooping
down in a half-bending posture. It is very often a great treat to hear
these garbis.
It may be remarked that girls—much less women—never take
part in them. Of course they may have their own garbis where men
would be excluded. In some families the custom of half-fasting
prevails. It is sufficient if only one member of the family fasts. The
fasting man has only one meal a day, and that, too, in the evening.
Moreover, he is not allowed any corn or pulse, but is restricted to fruit,
milk and  root vegetables such as potatoes, etc.
The tenth day of the month is called Dashara, when friends
meet and feast one another. It is also customary to make presents of
sweets to one's friends and especially patrons or superiors. Except on
the Dashara holiday all the amusements are carried on at night, while
the ordinary daily pursuits are attended to in the daytime. After
Dashara everything is comparatively quiet for about a fortnight,
except that the ladies are making preparations for the approaching
grand day, by cooking and baking sweets, cakes, etc., for, in India,
women of the highest class would not mind cooking. In fact, it is an
accomplishment which every lady is supposed to possess.
Thus, spending the evenings in feasting and singing, we reach
the thirteenth day of the dark half of the month Ashwin. (In India
every month is divided into two parts, the dark half and the bright
half, the full-moon day and the new-moon day being starting points;
thus, the day following the full-moon day is the first day of the dark
half of a month, and so on). The thirteenth day and the three
following days are wholly devoted to amusements and enjoyment.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 2, 68867) Diwali, which may be termed the Hindu Christmas, occurs at the end of the Hindu year, i.e., during the month of November.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 3, 68989) It is both a social and religious holiday.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 4, 69032) It spreads over nearly a month.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 5, 69064) The first day of the month of Ashwin (the twelfth month of the Hindu year) heralds the approach of the grand festival when the children let off their first fire-works.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 6, 69232) The first nine days are called Nava Ratri (nine nights).
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 7, 69289) These days are chiefly marked by garbis.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 8, 69330) Some twenty or thirty, and even more people form themselves into a large circle, in the centre is placed a huge lamp-post tastefully constructed and illuminated all round, in the centre also sits a man with his tabors reciting some popular verses.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 9, 69578) The people forming the circle repeat the verses, keeping time to them with claps of hands.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 10, 69669) While repeating the verses, they move round the lamp-post, at the same time stooping down in a half-bending posture.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 11, 69786) It is very often a great treat to hear these garbis.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 12, 69839) It may be remarked that girls—much less women—never take part in them.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 13, 69910) Of course they may have their own garbis where men would be excluded.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 14, 69980) In some families the custom of half-fasting prevails.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 15, 70034) It is sufficient if only one member of the family fasts.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 16, 70091) The fasting man has only one meal a day, and that, too, in the evening.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 28, 1, 17, 70163) Moreover, he is not allowed any corn or pulse, but is restricted to fruit, milk and root vegetables such as potatoes, etc.

New Para:  The thirteenth day is called Dhanteras, i.e., the thirteenth day set apart
for the worship of “Lakshmi”, the goddess of wealth. Rich people
collect different kinds of jewels, precious stones, coins, etc., and put
them carefully into a box. These they never use for any other purpose
than that of worship. Each year an addition is made to this collection.
The worship, i.e., the external worship—for who, save a select few, is
there who does not at heart covet, or in other words, worship
money?—consists in washing the money with water and milk, and
then decorating it with flowers and kumkum,  i.e., red ochre.
The fourteenth day is called Kali-Chaudash; but this day people
get up before the break of day, and even the laziest person is required
to take a good bath; the mother even compels her little children to
take a bath, though it is the winter season. On the night of Kali-
Chaudash, cemeteries are supposed to be visited by a procession of
ghosts. Persons affecting to believe in ghosts would go to these places
to see their ghost friends. Timid ones would not stir out of their
houses lest they should see a ghost.

The greatest fireworks are let off on the Divali day. No one is willing
to part with his money on this day. He will neither borrow nor lend.

You are standing near the corner of a public road. Mark the
shepherd trotting onward in his milk-white suit, worn for the first time,
with his long beard turned up beside his face and fastened under his
turban, singing some broken verses. A herd of cows, with their horns
painted red and green and mounted with silver, follows him. Soon
after you see a crowd of little maids, with small earthen vessels resting
on cushions placed on their heads. You wonder what those vessels
contain. Your doubt is soon solved by that careless maid spilling some
milk from her vessel. Then observe that big man with white whiskers
and a big white turban, with a long reed pen thrust into his turban. He
has a long scarf wound round his waist with a silver inkstand adjusted
in the scarf.  He, you must know, is a great banker. Thus you see

New Para:  The night comes. The streets are resplendent with dazzling
illumination; dazzling indeed to a person who has never seen Regent
Street or Oxford Street, but by no means to be compared with the
scale on which illuminations are carried out at the Crystal Palace,
except in large towns like Bombay. Men, women and children wear
their best costumes, almost all of various colours, and so form a
wonderfully bizarre effect, which harmonizes into kaleidoscopic
beauty. This is also the night for worshipping Saraswati, the goddess
of learning. Merchants start their new ledgers, by  making the first
entry. The officiating priest, the ubiquitous Brahmin, mutters some
prayers and invokes the goddess. At the end of the worship, the
children, who are only too impatient, set the fireworks ablaze; and as
this worship generally takes place at a fixed time, the streets resound
with the popping and fizzing and cracking of fireworks. Pious people
then go to the temples, but here too there is nothing to be seen but
mirth and glee, dazzling light and splendour.
The following day, i.e., the new year's day, is the day of paying
and receiving visits. Kitchen fires are put out on this day, so that
people eat the cold food which has been previously prepared. But  the
glutton by no means starves, for there is such profusion that though
he eats and eats again there is yet plenty and to spare. Well-to-do
classes buy and cook every sort of vegetables, corn and pulse, and
taste them all on the new year's day.
The second day of the new year is comparatively a quiet day.
Kitchen fires are now re-lighted. Light food is generally taken after
the heavy meals of the previous days. There is no display of fireworks
except by some mischievous children. Illumination, too, is on a
smaller scale. With the second day the Divali holidays are practically
over.
Let us see how these holidays affect society, and how many
desirable things people do unwittingly. Generally, all the family
members try to meet together for the holidays at their chief place of
residence. The husband always tries to get home to his wife again,
even though his business may have taken him away the whole of the
previous year. The father travels a great distance to meet his children.
The son, if abroad, comes back from his school and so a general
reunion always takes place. Then all who can afford it have new sets
of clothes. Among the richer classes ornaments, too, are ordered
especially for the occasion. Even old family quarrels are patched up.

same treatment is meted out to men without distinction. People form
themselves into small parties. Then one party competes with another
in using obscene language and singing obscene songs. All persons—
men and children, but not women—take part in these revolting
contests.
Indeed, it is not considered bad taste to use obscene words
during this season. In places where people are steeped in ignorance
they even pelt one another. They paint obscene words on your
clothes, and if you wear a white garment and go out, you are sure to
return home with plenty of mud about you. This reaches its climax on
the Holi day. Whether you are in the house or out of it, obscene words
are jarring on your ears. If you happen to visit a friend, you are sure
to be bathed in foul water, or in fragrant water, as the case may be.
In the evening, a big pile of wood or dried cow-dung is made
and set on fire. These piles are often as high as twenty feet or more.
And the pieces of wood used are so thick that the fire is not
extinguished for seven or eight days. On the day following, people
heat water on these fires and bathe with it.
So far I have spoken of the way in which the Holi holidays are
abused. It is a relief to be able to say that with the progress of
education and civilization such scenes are slowly, though surely, dying
out. But the richer and refined classes use these holidays in a very
decent way. Coloured water and fragrant waters take the place of mud.
Throwing pails of water is replaced here by a little sprinkling only.
Orange coloured water is most used during these days. It is made by
boiling dried flowers, called kesuda, which have the colour of an
orange. Rose water, too, is used where people can afford it. Friends
and relations meet and feast one another, and thus enjoy the spring in
merriment.

New Para:  Before I proceed to the subject of my address I should like to
tell you what are my qualifications for undertaking the task. When
Mill wrote the History of India, he, in his most interesting preface,
pointed out how he was qualified to write the book, though he had
never been to India, and was ignorant of the Indian languages. So I
think that in following his example, I shall be doing just what I ought
to do. Of course, the very idea of referring to one's qualifications for
any task argues some sort of unfitness on the part of the speaker or
writer, and I confess that I am not the person to speak upon the
“Foods of India”. I have undertaken the task not because I am
thoroughly competent to speak on the subject but because I thought I
would thereby be doing a service to the cause that both you and I
have at heart. My remarks are chiefly derived from my experience of
the Bombay Presidency. Now, as you know, India is a vast peninsula
populated by two hundred and eighty-five million souls. It is as large
as Europe less Russia. In such a country, the customs and manners in
different parts must be necessarily different. So, if in future you hear
anything different from what I am going to say, I request you to bear
in mind the above fact. As a general rule, my remarks will apply to the
whole of India.
I shall divide the subject into three parts. In the first place I shall
say something, by way of preliminary, about the people who live upon
the foods; secondly, I shall describe the foods; and thirdly, their uses,
etc.

New Para:  It is commonly believed that all the inhabitants of India are
vegetarians, but this is not true; and for that matter even all the Hindus
are not vegetarians. But it is quite true to say that the great majority of
the inhabitants of India are vegetarians
1* Some of them are so because
of their religion, while others are compelled to live on vegetable foods
because they cannot afford to pay for meat. This will be quite clear to
you when I tell you that there are millions in India who live upon one
pice-i.e., one-third of a penny-a day, and even in a poverty-stricken
country like India you cannot get eatable meat for that sum. These
poor people have only one meal per day, and that consists of stale
bread and salt, a heavily taxed article. But Indian vegetarians and
meat-eaters are quite different from English vegetarians and meat-
eaters. Indian meat-eaters, unlike English meat-eaters, do not believe
that they will die without meat. So far as my knowledge goes, they
(the Indian meat-eaters) do not consider meat a necessity of life but a
mere luxury. If they can get their roti, as bread is generally called
there, they get on very well without their meat. But look at our English
meat-eater; he thinks that he must have his meat. Bread simply helps
him to eat meat, while the Indian meat-eater thinks that meat will help
him to eat his bread.
I was talking the other day to an English lady on the ethics of
diet, and she exclaimed, while I was telling her how even she could
easily become a vegetarian, “Say what you will, I must have my meat,
I am so fond of it, and am positively sure I cannot live without it.”
“But, madam,” I said, “suppose that you were compelled to live on a
strictly vegetable diet, how would you manage then?” “Oh,” she said,
“don't talk of that. I know I could not be compelled to do so, and if I
were I should feel very uncomfortable.” Of course, no one can blame
the lady for so saying. Society is in such a position for the present that
it is impossible for any meat-eater to leave off eating meat without
much difficulty.
In the same manner, an Indian vegetarian is quite different from
an English one. The former simply abstains from anything that

further. Therefore he does not take eggs, because he thinks that in
taking an egg he would kill a would-be life. (I am sorry to say I have
been taking eggs for about a month and half.) But he does not
hesitate to use milk and butter. He even uses these animal products, as
they are called here, on fruit days, which occur every fortnight. On
these days he is forbidden wheat, rice, etc., but he can use as much
butter and milk as he likes; while, as we know, some of the vegetarians
here discard butter and milk, some do away with cooking, and some
even try to live on fruits and nuts.
I will now pass to the description of our different foods. I must
say that I shall not dwell upon the flesh foods at all, as these, even
where they are used, do not form the staple article of food. India is
preeminently an agricultural country, and a very large one. So
itsproducts  are numerous and varied. Though the foundation of the
British rule in India dates from the year 1746 A.D*, and though India
was known to the English much earlier than 1746, it is a pity that so
little should be known of the foods of India in England. We have not
to go very far to seek the cause. Almost all Englishmen who go to
India keep up their own way of living. They not only insist on having
the things they had in England, but will also have them cooked in the
same way. It is not for me here to go into the why and wherefore of
all these incidents. One would have thought that they would look into
the habits of the people, if only out of curiosity, but they have done
nothing of the kind, and hence we see the result of their stolid indif-
ference in the loss to many Anglo-Indians of the finest opportunities
of studying the food question. To return to the foods, there are many
kinds of corn produced in India which are absolutely unknown here.
Wheat, however, is, of course, of the greatest importance there as
here. Then there are bajara (which is called millet by the Anglo-
Indians), joar, rice, etc. These are what I should call bread foods,
because they are chiefly used for bread-making. Wheat, of course, in
greatly used, but it being comparatively dear, bajara and joar take its
place among the poor classes. This is very much so in the southern
and the northern provinces. Speaking of the southern provinces, in his

New Para:  people consists chiefly of small grains, such as joar, bajara, ragi.”  Of
the north, he says: “The two last (i.e., joar and bajara) form the food
of the masses, rice being only grown on irrigated lands and consumed
by the rich.” It is not at all unusual to find persons who have not
tasted joar. Joar being the diet of the poor, it is held in reverence, as it
were. Instead of good-bye as the parting salute, the poor in India say
'joar', which, when extended and translated, would, I think, mean:
“May you never be without 'joar'.”
1 The rice, too, is used for bread-
making, especially in Bengal. The Bengalees use rice more than
wheat. In other parts, rice, as an article for bread-making, is rarely, if
ever, used.  Chana, or gram as it is called by the Anglo-Indians, is
sometimes used for the same purpose, either in combination with or
without wheat. It closely resembles peas in taste and shape. This brings
me to the various kinds of pulses for soup-making, or dal. Gram, peas,
lentils, haricot beans, tuar, mug, muth, urad are the chief pulses used
for dal. Of these, I think, tuar heads the list in popularity. Both these
kinds of foods are chiefly used when dried. Now I come to the green
vegetables. It would be useless to give you names of all the vegetables.
They are so numerous that I am sure there are many of them that I do
not know. The soil of India is so rich that it can produce any
vegetable you like. So we may safely say that with a proper
knowledge of agriculture, the Indian soil may be made to produce
any vegetable to be found on earth.
There now remains fruit and nuts. I am sorry to say that the
proper value of fruits is not known in India. Though it is used in
abundance, it is used rather as a luxury than anything else. It is used
more for the sake of its palatable taste than of health. Therefore, we
do not get such valuable fruits as oranges, apples, etc., in plenty; hence
they are available only to the rich. But we get plenty of seasonal fruits
and dried fruits. Summer in India, as everywhere, is the best season for
the former. Of these, the mango is the most important. It is the most
delicious fruit I have yet tasted. Some have placed the pineapple at the
top of the list; but a great majority of those who have tasted the
mango vote in its favour. It remains in season for three months, when
it is very cheap, and consequently both the rich and the poor can
enjoy it. I have heard that some even live on mangoes—of course,
only while they are in season. But, unfortunately, the mango is a fruit
that will not keep long in a good condition. It resembles the peach in

New Para:  taste, and is a stone-fruit. It is often as big as a small melon. That
brings us to the melons, which are also plentiful in summer. They are
far superior to what we get here. However, I must not inflict any more
names of fruits on you; suffice it to say that India produces
innumerable varieties of seasonal fruits, which do not keep long. All
these fruits are available to the poor; the pity is that they never make a
meal of these fruits. Generally, we believe that fruit causes fever,
diarrhoea, etc. In summer, when we always dread cholera, authorities
prohibit—rightly, too, in many cases—the sale of melons and other
such fruits. As for dried fruits, we get almost all the varieties that are to
be had here. Of nuts we get some varieties which you do not get here;
on the other hand, some that are to be had here are not seen in India.
Nuts are never used as food in India; and so, properly speaking, they
should not be included in the “Foods of India”. Now, before I come
to the last division of my subject, I should request you to bear in mind
the following divisions that I have made: first, corn for bread-making,
e.g., wheat, millet, etc.; second, pulse, for dal or soup-making; third,
green vegetables; fourth, fruits; and, fifth and last, nuts.
Of course, I am not going to give you recipes for cooking these
different kinds of foods. That is beyond my power. I shall tell you the
general way in which they are cooked for their proper uses. Diet cure
or hygiene is a comparatively recent discovery in England. In India
we have been practising this from time out of mind. Native physicians
no doubt, use drugs, too, but they depend more upon change of diet
than upon the efficacy of the drugs they prescribe. They would ask
you to take salt in certain cases; in many, they would ask you to
abstain from acid foods, and so on, every food having its medical
value. As for the corn for bread-making, it is the most important
article of diet. For convenience, I have called the preparation made of
flour bread, but cake would be a better name for it. I shall not relate
the whole process of making it, but I may just say that we do not
throw away the bran. These cakes are always fresh made, and
generally eaten hot with clarified butter. They are to the Indians what
meat is to the English. The quantity of food a person eats is measured
according to the number of cakes he eats. Pulse and vegetables are left
out of account. You may make a meal without pulse, without
vegetables, but never without cakes. Different preparations, too are
made of the various kinds of corns, but they are merely cakes in
disguise.

New Para:  Pulse for soup-making, e.g., peas, lentils, etc., is prepared by
simply boiling it in water.  But an addition of innumerable
condiments makes it a most delicious dish. The art of cooking  has
full play in these foods. I have known peas spiced with salt, pepper,
turmeric, cloves, cinnamon, and such like. The proper use of pulse is
to help you to eat the cakes.  Medically, it is not supposed good to
take too much of the pulses. A remark on rice here would not be out
of place. As I have already said, rice is used for bread-making,
especially in Bengal. Some of the doctors trace the diabetes from
which the Bengalees very often suffer to this  source. No one in India
would call rice a nourishing food. It is the food of the rich, i.e., of
people who do not want to work. Labouring men very rarely use rice.
Physicians put their feverish patients on rice. I have suffered from
fever (no   doubt by breaking hygienic rules, as   Dr* Allinson would
say), and was put upon a diet of rice and mug-water. Recovery was
marvellous.
Next come green vegetables. These are prepared in much the
same way as pulses. Oil and butter play an important part in the
preparation of vegetables. Often gram flour is mixed with them.
Simply boiled vegetables are never eaten. I never saw a boiled potato
in India. Not infrequently they make a combination of many
vegetables. It is needless to say that India would far outbid France in
cooking vegetables nicely. Their proper use is much the same  as that
of pulse. In importance they stand next to it. They are more or less a
luxury, and are generally supposed to be a source of disease. Poor
people have hardly one vegetable once or twice a week. They would
have cakes and dal. Some of the vegetables have an excellent
medicinal value. There is one vegetable called tandalja. It very closely
resembles spinach in taste. Physicians prescribe it to persons who have
indulged in too much cayenne pepper and spoiled their eyesight
thereby.
Then come fruits. They are used chiefly on “fruit days”, but
are rarely, if ever, used at the end of ordinary meals. People generally
take them now and then. Mango-juice is very greatly used in the
mango-season. It is eaten with cakes or rice. We never cook or stew
ripe fruits. We preserve unripe fruits, chiefly mangoes, while acid.
Medicinally, fresh fruits, being generally acid, are supposed to have a
tendency to give fever. Dried fruits are much used by children, and
dried dates deserve some notice. We suppose them to be strength-

prepare them with milk and various other things too numerous to be
mentioned, and eat an ounce every day.
Lastly, nuts take the place of English sweets. Children eat a great
quantity of sugared nuts. They are also largely used on “fruit days”.
We fry them in butter, and even stew them in milk. Almonds are
supposed to be very good for the brain. I will just point out one of the
various ways in which we use the cocoanut. It is first ground and then
mixed with clarified butter and sugar. It tastes very nice. I hope some
of you will try at home those coconut sweet balls as they are called.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is a sketch—a most imperfect sketch—of
foods of India. I hope you will be induced to learn more  about them,
and I am sure you will profit by doing so. In conclusion, I further
hope the time will come when the great difference now existing
between the food habits of meat-eating in England and grain-eating in
India will disappear, and with it some other differences which, in some
quarters, mar the unity of sympathy that ought to exist between the
two countries. In the future, I hope we shall tend towards unity of
custom, and also unity of hearts.

what were your difficulties, and how you overcame them.
Even to try to tell you the story of my difficulties would fill up

difficulties may well be likened to the heads of Ravana-the giant of
the second

fought, and ultimately defeated—which were many, and which were
no sooner chopped off than replaced. They may be divided chiefly
under four heads, viz., money, consent of my elders, separation from
relations, and caste restrictions.
First, then, as to money. Though my father was the prime
minister of more than one native State, he never hoarded money. He
spent all that he earned in charity and the education and marriages of
his children, so we were practically left without much cash. He left
some property, and that was all. When asked why he did not collect
money and set it aside for his children, he used to say that his children

them. So, then, money was no small difficulty in my way. I tried for
some State scholarship but failed. At one place, I was asked to prove
my worth by graduating and then expect it. Experience teaches me
that the gentleman who said so was right. Not daunted, I requested my
eldest brother to  devote all the money that was left to my education in  
England.
Here I cannot help digressing to explain the family system that
prevails in India. There, unlike as in England, the children always, if
male, and until marriage, if female, live with their parents. What they
earn goes to the father, and so  also what they lose is a loss to the
father. Of course, even the male children do separate  under
exceptional circumstances, e.g., in the case of a great quarrel. But
these are the exceptions. In the legal languages of Mayne:
“Individual property is the rule in the West.  Corporate property is the
rule in the East.”  So then Everything was under the control of my
brother, and we were all living together.
To return to the question of money. What little my father could
leave for me was in the hands of my brother. It could only be set free
subject to his consent. Moreover, that was not enough, so I proposed
that the whole capital should be devoted to my education I ask you if
any brother would do so here. There are very few such brothers in
India. He was told that I might prove an unworthy brother after
imbibing the Western ideas, and that the only chance of regaining the
money would be in my returning alive to India, which was very
doubtful. But he turned a deaf ear to all these reasonable and well-
meant warnings. There was one, and only one condition attached to
the consent to my proposal, viz., that I should get the permission of
my mother and my uncle. May many persons have such brothers as
mine! I then set about the allotted task, which I can assure you was
uphill enough. Fortunately, I was the pet of my mother. She had
much faith in me, and so I succeeded in getting over her superstition,
but how was I to make her nod consent to a three years' separation?
However, by showing the exaggerated advantages of coming to
England, I got her to accede, with much reluctance, to my request.
Now for the uncle. He was on the point of going to Benares and such
other holy places. After three days' incessant persuasion and
arguments I could get the following answer from him :

New Para:  how could I willingly say ‘yes’ to your unholy proposal? The only
thing I can say is that, if your mother does not mind your going, I
have no right to interfere.”
This was easily interpreted into ‘yes’. Nor were these the only
two whom I had to please. In India everyone, no matter how remotely
connected, thinks that he has a right to poke his nose into another's
affairs. But when I had exacted (for it was nothing else) acquiescence
from the two, the pecuniary difficulties almost disappeared.
The difficulties under the second head are partially discussed
above. You will, perhaps, be astonished to hear that I am married.
(The marriage took place at the age of twelve.) Small blame then to
my wife's parents if they thought that they had a right to interfere if
only for the sake of their daughter. Who was to look after her? How
was she to manage to spend the three years? Of course she was to be
looked after by my brother. Poor brother! According to my ideas at
that time, I should have taken little notice of their legitimate fears and
growlings, had it not been that their displeasure would have been
reflected on my mother and brother. It was no easy task to sit night
after night with my father- in-law and to hear and successfully answer
his objections. But then I was taught the old proverb, “Patience and
perseverance overcome mountains”, too well to give way.
When I had the money and the requisite permission, I said to
myself, “How am I to persuade myself to separate from all that is dear
and near to me?” In India we fight shy of separation. Even when I
had to go for a few days my mother would weep. How, then, was I to
witness, without being affected, the heart-rending scene? It is
impossible for me to describe the tortures that my mind had to suffer.
As the day of leave-taking drew near I nearly broke down. But I was
wise enough not to say this, even to my closest friends. I knew that my
health was failing. Sleeping, waking, drinking, eating, walking,
running, reading, I was dreaming and thinking of England and what I
would do on that momentous day. At last the day came. On the one
hand, my mother was hiding her eyes, full of tears, in her hands, but
the sobbing was clearly heard. On the other, I was placed among a
circle of some fifty friends. “If I wept they would think me too weak;
perhaps they would not allow me to go to England,” soliloquized I;
therefore I did not weep, even though my heart was breaking. Last,
but not least, came the leave-taking with my wife. It would be contrary

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 3, 106423) The only thing I can say is that, if your mother does not mind your going, I have no right to interfere.” This was easily interpreted into ‘yes’.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 4, 106569) Nor were these the only two whom I had to please.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 5, 106619) In India everyone, no matter how remotely connected, thinks that he has a right to poke his nose into another's affairs.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 6, 106740) But when I had exacted (for it was nothing else) acquiescence from the two, the pecuniary difficulties almost disappeared.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 7, 106863) The difficulties under the second head are partially discussed above.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 8, 106933) You will, perhaps, be astonished to hear that I am married.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 9, 106993) (The marriage took place at the age of twelve.) Small blame then to my wife's parents if they thought that they had a right to interfere if only for the sake of their daughter.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 10, 107170) Who was to look after her?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 11, 107197) How was she to manage to spend the three years?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 12, 107245) Of course she was to be looked after by my brother.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 13, 107297) Poor brother!
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 14, 107311) According to my ideas at that time, I should have taken little notice of their legitimate fears and growlings, had it not been that their displeasure would have been reflected on my mother and brother.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 15, 107513) It was no easy task to sit night after night with my father- in-law and to hear and successfully answer his objections.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 16, 107633) But then I was taught the old proverb, “Patience and perseverance overcome mountains”, too well to give way.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 17, 107742) When I had the money and the requisite permission, I said to myself, “How am I to persuade myself to separate from all that is dear and near to me?” In India we fight shy of separation.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 18, 107928) Even when I had to go for a few days my mother would weep.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 19, 107987) How, then, was I to witness, without being affected, the heart-rending scene?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 20, 108065) It is impossible for me to describe the tortures that my mind had to suffer.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 21, 108142) As the day of leave-taking drew near I nearly broke down.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 22, 108200) But I was wise enough not to say this, even to my closest friends.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 23, 108267) I knew that my health was failing.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 24, 108302) Sleeping, waking, drinking, eating, walking, running, reading, I was dreaming and thinking of England and what I would do on that momentous day.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 25, 108447) At last the day came.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 26, 108469) On the one hand, my mother was hiding her eyes, full of tears, in her hands, but the sobbing was clearly heard.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 27, 108581) On the other, I was placed among a circle of some fifty friends.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 28, 108646) “If I wept they would think me too weak; perhaps they would not allow me to go to England,” soliloquized I; therefore I did not weep, even though my heart was breaking.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 29, 108815) Last, but not least, came the leave-taking with my wife.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 43, 1, 30, 108872) It would be contrary to custom for me to see or talk to her in the presence of friends.

New Para:  had to see her in a separate room. She, of course, had begun sobbing
long before. I went to her and stood like a dumb statue for a moment.
I kissed her, and she said, “Don't go”. What followed I need not
describe. This done, my anxieties were not over. It was but the
beginning of the end. The leave-taking was only half done, for I
parted with the mother and the wife in Rajkot—where I was
educated—but my brother and friends came to see me off as far as
Bombay. The scene that took place there was no less affecting.
The collisions with my caste fellows in Bombay defy
description, for Bombay is the place where they chiefly live. In Rajkot
I did not meet with any such opposition worthy of the name. It was
my misfortune to live in the heart of the city of Bombay, where they
most abound, so I was hemmed in on all sides. I could not go out
without being pointed and stared at by someone or other. At one time,
while I was walking near the Town Hall, I was surrounded and hooted
by them, and my poor brother had to look at the scene in silence. The
culminating point was reached when a huge meeting of the caste
fellows was summoned by the chief representatives. Every member of
the caste was called upon to attend the meeting, under pain of
forfeiting a fine of five annas. I may here mention that, before this
step was determined upon, I was pestered with many deputations from
them without avail. At this great meeting, I was seated in the centre of
the audience. The Patels, as the representatives are called, remonstrated
with me very strongly and reminded me of their connection with my
father. It may be mentioned that all this was quite a unique experience
to me. They literally dragged me out of seclusion, for I was not
accustomed to such things. Moreover, my position became more
precarious on account of an 
extreme shyness. Seeing that
remonstrance fell flat on me, the head Patel addressed me (in effect)
in the following words: “We were your father's friends, and therefore
we feel for you; as heads of the caste you know our power. We are
positively informed that you will have to eat flesh and drink wine in
England; moreover, you have to cross the waters; all this you must
know is against our caste rules. Therefore we command you to
reconsider your decision, or else the heaviest punishment will be
meted out to you. What have you to say to this?”
I replied in the following words: “I thank you for your
warnings. I am sorry that I cannot alter my decision. What I have
heard about England is quite different from what you say; one need

brethren can go as far as Aden, why could not I go to England? I am
deeply convinced that malice is at the root of all these objections.”
“Very well, then,” replied the worthy Patel in anger, “You are
not the son of your father.” Then, turning to the audience, he went
on: “This boy has lost his sense, and we command everyone not to
have anything to do with him. He who will support him in any way or
go to see him off will be treated as an outcaste, and if the boy ever
returns, let him know that he shall never be taken into the caste.”
These words fell like a bombshell upon all. Even the chosen few
who had supported me through thick and thin left me alone. I had a
great mind to answer the childish taunt, but was prevented from so
doing by my brother. Thus even though I got out of the ordeal safely,
my position became worse than ever. Even my brother began to
vacillate, though only for a moment. He was reminded of the threat
that the pecuniary support from him would cost him not only the
money, but his membership of the caste. So although he did not say
anything to me in person, he asked some of his friends to persuade
me either to reconsider my decision or to defer its execution till the
fury had subsided. There could be but one answer from me, and ever
since that he never flinched, and, in fact, he has not been
excommunicated; but the end had not come yet. The intrigues of the
caste fellows were always at work. They almost seemed to have scored
this time, for they could put off my going for a fortnight. They
carried it out thuswise. We went to see a captain of a steamship
company, who was requested to say that it would be unwise for me to
leave during that time—August—because of the rough weather in the
sea. My brother would consent to anything but this. Unfortunately,
this was the first voyage that I had undertaken, so no one knew
whether I was a good sailor or not, so I was helpless, Much against my
will I had to put off the departure. I thought the whole structure would
fall to the ground. My brother, having left a note to a friend,
requesting him to give me the passage money when the time came,
took leave. The parting scene was similar to the one described above.
Now I was left alone in Bombay without money to buy the passage.
Every hour that I had to wait seemed a year. In the meanwhile I heard

New Para:  On  your arrival in England, of course, you were face to face with the flesh-
eating problem; how did you solve it?
I was overwhelmed with gratuitous advice. Well-meaning yet
ignorant friends thrust their opinions into unwilling ears. The majority
of them said I could not do without meat in the cold climate. I would
catch consumption. Mr* Z went to England and caught it on account
of his foolhardiness. Others said I might do without flesh but without
wine I could not move. I would be numbed with cold. One went so far
as to advise me to take eight bottles of whisky, for I should want them
after leaving Aden. Another wanted me to smoke, for his friend was
obliged to smoke in England. Even medical men, those who had been
to England, told the same tale. But as I wanted to come at any price, I
replied that I would try my best to avoid all these things, but if they
were found to be absolutely necessary I did not know what I should
do. I may here mention that my aversion to meat was not so strong
then as it is now. I was even betrayed into taking meat about six or
seven times at the period when I allowed my friends to think for me.
But in the steamer my ideas began to change. I thought I should not
take meat on any account. My mother before consenting to my
departure exacted a promise from me not to take meat. So I was
bound not to take it, if only for the sake of the promise. The fellow-

on this proving false, a fellow-passenger said, “The weather has not

death, and meat and wine “ That crisis too passed away safely. In
London, too, I had to hear such remonstrances. For months I did not
come across any vegetarian. I passed many anxious days arguing with
a friend about the sufficiency of the vegetable diet; but at that time
having but little knowledge of arguments other than humanitarian in
favour of vegetarianism, I got the worst of it as the friend scouted the
idea of humanity in such discussions. At last I sealed his tongue by
telling him I would sooner die than break the promise to my mother.
“Humph,” said he, “childishness, rank superstition; but since, even
after coming here, you are superstitious enough to believe in such
nonsense, I cannot help you any more, I only wish you had not come
to England.”
He never afterwards pressed the point seriously, except perhaps
once, though ever since that he took me for little more than a fool. In
the meanwhile I remembered once to have passed by a vegetarian
restaurant (it was the “Porridge Bowl”). I asked a gentleman to direct
me there, but instead of reaching there I saw the “Central” restaurant,
and went there and had some porridge for the first time. I did not at

New Para:  I could not make myself believe that I was going to India until I
stepped into the steamship Oceana, of the P* & O* Company. So much
attached was I to London and its environments for who would not be?
London with its teaching institutions, public galleries, museums,
theatres,  vast commerce, public parks and vegetarian restaurants, is a
fit place for a student and a traveller, a trader and a “addist”—as a
vegetarian would be called by his opponents. Thus, it was not without
deep regret that I left dear London. At the same time I was glad
because I was to see my friends and relations in India after such a
long time.
Oceana is an Australian steamer, one of the largest boats of the
Company. She weighs 6,188 tons and her horse-power is 1,200* When
we stepped into this vast floating island, we were treated to a good
refreshing tea, to which all (passengers and friends alike) did justice. I
must not omit to say that the tea was served gratis. At this time, a
stranger would have taken them all for passengers (and they were a
goodly number), from the ease with which they were taking their tea;
but, when the bell rang to inform the friends of the passengers that the
ship was going to weigh anchor, the number appreciably melted away.
There was much cheering and waving of handkerchiefs when the ship
steamed off the harbour.
It may be well here to contrast the Oceana with the Assam into
which the Bombay-bound passengers had to transship at Aden. There
were English waiters on the Oceana, always neat, clean and obliging.
On the other hand, there were Portuguese waiters on board the Assam,
who murdered the Queen's English, and who were always the reverse
of clean, and also sulky and slow.
There was, moreover, a difference of quality in the food
supplied in the two steamers. This was evident from the way in which
the passengers were grumbling in the Assam. Nor was this all. The
accommodation in the Oceana far outdid that in the Assam; this,
however, the company could not help; they could not throw away the
latter because the former was better.
How did the vegetarians manage in the ship? This would be an
apt question.
Well, there were only two vegetarians, including myself. Both of
us were prepared, in case we did not get anything better, to manage
with boiled potatoes, cabbage and butter. But we had no reason to go
to that extreme. The obliging steward gave us some vegetable curry,

brown bread; so we had all we wanted. Undoubtedly, they are very
liberal in giving good and sufficient food to the passengers. Only,
they go too far; so at least it seems to me.
It would not be amiss to describe what the second-saloon menus
contained, and how many meals the passengers had.
To begin with, the first thing in the morning, an average
passenger would have a cup or two of tea and a few biscuits. At 8*30
a.m. the breakfast bell would bring down the passengers to the dining-
room. They were punctual to the minute, at their meals, at any rate.
The breakfast menu generally contained oatmeal porridge, some fish,
chop, curry, jam, bread and butter, tea or coffee, etc., everything ad
libitum.
I have often seen passengers take porridge, fish and curry, bread
and butter, and wash down with two or three cups of tea.
Hardly had we time to digest the breakfast, when, bang,-it was
the dinner bell at 1*30 p.m. The dinner was as good as breakfast:
plenty of mutton and vegetables, rice and curry, pastry, and what not.
Two days of the week, all the second-saloon passengers were served
with fruit and nuts in addition to the ordinary dinner. But this, too, was
not sufficient. The dinner fare was so easily digestible that we wanted
a “refreshing” cup of tea and biscuits at 4 p.m. Well, but the evening
breezes seemed so soon to take away all the effect of “that little” cup
of tea that we were served a “high tea” at 6*30 p.m.: bread and butter,
jam or marmalade, or both, salad, chops, tea, coffee, etc. The sea-air
seemed to be so very salubrious that the passengers could not retire to
bed before taking a few, a very few—only eight or ten, fifteen at the
most—biscuits, a little cheese and some wine or beer. In the light of
the above, are not the following lines too true:

games, etc. But after two or three days, the time between the meals
seemed to hang heavy in spite of discussions and cards and scandals.
Some of us really warmed to the work and got up concerts, tugs-
of-war, and running races for prizes. One evening was devoted to
concerts and speeches.
 Now, I thought it was time for me to poke my nose in. I
requested the secretary of the committee, who managed those things,
to give me a quarter of an hour for a short speech on vegetarianism.
The secretary obligingly nodded consent to my request.
Well, I made grand preparations. I thought out and then wrote
out and re-wrote the speech that was to be delivered. I well knew that I
had to meet a hostile audience, and that I should take care that my
speech did not send my audience to sleep. The secretary had asked
me to be humorous. I told him that I might be nervous, but humorous
I could not be.
Now, what do you think became of the speech? The second
concert never came off, and so the speech was never delivered, to my
great mortification. I fancy it was because no one seemed to enjoy the
first evening, for we had no Pitts and Gladstones in the second saloon.
However, I succeeded in discussing vegetarianism with two or
three passengers, who heard me calmly, and answered in effect, “We
grant you the argument; but so long as we feel happy on our present
diet (never mind about our being dyspeptic at times), we cannot give it
a trial!”
One of them, seeing that my vegetarian friend and I got nice
fruits every day, did give the V.E.M* diet a trial, but the chop was too
great a temptation for him.
Poor man!

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 3, 125666) But after two or three days, the time between the meals seemed to hang heavy in spite of discussions and cards and scandals.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 4, 125791) Some of us really warmed to the work and got up concerts, tugs- of-war, and running races for prizes.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 5, 125893) One evening was devoted to concerts and speeches.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 6, 125943) Now, I thought it was time for me to poke my nose in.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 7, 125997) I requested the secretary of the committee, who managed those things, to give me a quarter of an hour for a short speech on vegetarianism.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 8, 126136) The secretary obligingly nodded consent to my request.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 9, 126191) Well, I made grand preparations.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 10, 126224) I thought out and then wrote out and re-wrote the speech that was to be delivered.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 11, 126307) I well knew that I had to meet a hostile audience, and that I should take care that my speech did not send my audience to sleep.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 12, 126436) The secretary had asked me to be humorous.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 13, 126479) I told him that I might be nervous, but humorous I could not be.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 14, 126544) Now, what do you think became of the speech?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 15, 126589) The second concert never came off, and so the speech was never delivered, to my great mortification.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 51, 1, 16, 126690) I fancy it was because no one seemed to enjoy the first evening, for we had no Pitts and Gladstones in the second saloon.

the passengers thought fit to get drunk (beg your pardon, Mr* Editor,
they got drunk almost every evening, but this particular evening they
got drunk and disorderly). They, it seems, were discussing with one
another over a glass of whisky, when some of them used improper
language. Then followed a fight of words culminating in a fight of
blows. The matter was reported to the captain. He reproved these
pugilistic gentlemen, and ever since then we had no more rows.
Thus, dividing our time between eating and amusements, we
moved onward.
After two days' voyage, the steamer passed by, but did not touch,
Gibraltar. This caused much disappointment, mostly among smokers,
who wanted to get tobacco, duty-free in Gibraltar, as some of us had
entertained a hope the steamer would cast anchor.
The next place reached was Malta. It being a coaling station, the
steamer stops there for about nine hours. Almost all the passengers
went ashore.
Malta is a beautiful island without the London smoke. The
construction of houses is different. We had a look round the
Governor's palace. The armoury is well worth a visit. Napoleon's
carriage is on view there. You see there some beautiful paintings too.
The market is not bad. The fruit is cheap. The cathedral is
magnificent.
We had a nice drive of about six miles to the orange garden.
There you see some thousands of orange trees and some ponds with
gold fish. The drive was very cheap, only 2s. 6d.
What a wretched place Malta is for beggars! You cannot go
along the road quietly without being pestered by a crowd of dirty-
looking beggars. Some would offer to be your guides, others would
offer to take you to shops where you could buy cigars or the famous
Maltese sweet nougat.
From Malta we reached Brindisi. It is a good harbour and that is
all. You cannot pass a single day in amusement. We had about nine
hours or more at our disposal, but we could not utilize even four.
After Brindisi we reached Port Said. There we took final leave of
Europe and the Mediterranean. Of course, there is nothing to be seen
in Port Said, unless you want to see the dregs of society. It is full of
rogues and rascals.

New Para:  From Port Said the steamer moves along very slowly, for we
enter the Suez Canal of M* de Lesseps. It is a distance of eighty-seven
miles. The steamer took nearly twenty-four hours to travel that
distance. We were close to the land on both sides. The strip of water is
so narrow that two steamers cannot go abreast except at certain places.
At night the sight is charming. All the ships are required to light
electric lights in front and these are very powerful. The scene when
two ships pass one another is very pleasant. The electric light you get
from the opposite ship is simply dazzling.
 We passed the Ganges. We raised three cheers for her, which
were heartily returned by the passengers on board the Ganges. The
town Suez is at the other end of the canal. The steamer hardly stops
there for half an hour.
Now we entered the Red Sea. It was a three days' voyage but it
was most trying. It was unbearably hot. Not only was it impossible to
remain inside the steamer, but it was too hot even on the deck. Here,
for the first time, we felt that we were going to India to face the hot
climate.
We had some breeze when we reached Aden. Here, we (the
passengers for Bombay) had to transship into the Assam.. It was like
leaving London for a miserable village. The Assam is hardly half as
big as the Oceana.
Misfortunes never come single; with the Assam we had a stormy
ocean, because it was the monsoon season. The Indian Ocean is
generally calm, so during monsoon it is stormy with a vengeance. We
had to pass five days more on the waters before we reached Bombay.
The second night brought the real storm. Many were sick. If I
ventured out on the deck I was splashed with water. There goes a
crash; something is broken. In the cabin you cannot sleep quietly.
The door is banging. Your bags begin to dance. You roll in your bed.
You sometimes feel as if the ship is sinking. At the dinner table you
are no more comfortable. The steamer rolls on your side. Your forks
and spoons are in your lap, even the cruet stand and the soup plate;
your napkin is dyed yellow and so on.
One morning I asked the steward if that was what he would call a
real storm, and he said: “No, sir, this is nothing.” and, waving his arm,
showed me how the steamer would roll in a real storm.
Thus tossed up and down, we reached Bombay on July 5th. It
was raining very hard and so it was difficult going ashore. However,
we reached the shore safely, and bade good-bye to the Assam.

New Para:  MY DEAR PATWARI,
I thank you for your kind letter and the advice you have given
me.
As I told you in my last p.c., I have to postpone going abroad
for practice. My brother is very much against it. He thinks that I need
not despair of getting a decent livelihood in Kathiawar1 and that
without directly taking part in the khutput
2* However this may be,
since he is so hopeful and is entitled to every consideration from me, I
shall follow his advice. Here, too, I have been promised some work. So
I intend to be here for about two months at least. I do not think my
accepting a literary post will materially interfere with my legal studies.
On the other hand, such a work will add to my knowledge that cannot
but be indirectly useful in practice. Moreover, thereby I can work with
a more concentrated mind free from worry, but where is the post? Not
an easy thing to get one.
Of course, I asked for a loan on the strength of the promise you
made me while at Rajkot. I entirely agree with you that your father
should not know of it. Never mind about it now. I shall try somewhere
else. I can easily understand that you cannot have a large surplus from
one year's practice.
My brother has been retained in Sachin as Secretary to the
Nawab of Sachin. He has gone to Rajkot and will return in a few days.

The caste opposition is as great as ever. Everything depends
upon one man who will try his best never to allow me to enter the
caste. I am not so very sorry for myself as I am for the caste fellows
who follow the authority of one man like sheep. They have been
passing  some meaningless resolutions and betraying their malice
clerly in overdoing their part. Religion, of course, finds no place in
their arguments. Is it not almost better not to have anything to do with
such fellows than to fawn upon them and wheedle their fame so that I
might be considered one of them? However, I have to move with the

New Para:  sorry if His Worship the Magistrate looked at me with disapproval. It
is true that on entering the Court I neither removed my head-dress nor
salaamed, but in so doing I had not the slightest idea that I was
offending His Worship, or meaning any disrespect to the Court. Just
as it is a mark of respect amongst the Europeans to take off their hats,
in like manner it is in Indians to retain one's head-dress. To appear
uncovered before a gentleman is not to respect him. In England, on
attending drawing-room meetings and evening parties, Indians always
keep the head-dress, and the English ladies and gentlemen generally
seem to appreciate the regard which we show thereby. In High Courts
in India those Indian advocates who have not discarded their native
head-dress invariably keep it on.
As to bowing, or salaaming as you would call it, I again followed
the rule observed in the Bombay High Court. If an advocate enters the
Court after the judge has taken his seat on the bench he does not bow,
but all the advocates rise up when the judge enters the Court, and keep
standing until the judge has taken his seat. Accordingly, yesterday
when His Worship entered the Court I rose up, and took my seat only
after His Worship had done so.
The paragraph seems to convey also that though I was told
privately not to keep my seat at the horseshoe, I nevertheless
“returned to the horseshoe”. The truth is that I was taken by the chief
clerk to the interpreters' room, and was asked not to take my seat at
the horseshoe the next time I came unless I produced my credentials.
To make assurance doubly sure I asked the chief clerk if I could
retain my seat for the day, and he very kindly said “yes”. I was
therefore really surprised to be told again in open court that in order
to be entitled to the seat I had to produce credentials, etc.
Lastly, I beg His Worship's pardon if he was offended at what he
considered to be my rudeness, which was the result of ignorance and
quite unintentional.
I hope, in fairness, you will extend me the favour of finding the
above explanation a space in your paper, as the paragraph, if

New Para:  The reasons, so far as I can gather from your leading article of the
15th instant, can be summed up in the following words: “One Asiatic
has gone into insolvency, and paid 5d. in the £. This is a fair sample
of an Asiatic trader. He has driven out the small European trader.”
Now, granting that a majority of Asiatic traders do become
insolvent, and pay very little to their creditors (which is not at all the
case), is that a good reason for driving them out of the Colony or
South Africa? Does it not rather show that there must be a defect in
the Insolvency Law that they can thus ruin their creditors? If the law
would give any latitude for such practices, people would take
advantage of it. Do not the Europeans seek the protection of the
Insolvency Court? I do not, of course, mean to defend the Indian
traders by this tu quoque argument. I sincerely regret that the Indians
should resort to such practices at all. It is a disgrace to their
country,which one time had too great an idea of its honour to be
associated with any dishonest dealing in trade. But it certainly seems
to me that a case is not made out for expelling the Indian traders on
the strength of the fact of their availing themselves of the law of
bankruptcy. Not only can the law put a stop to the frequent
occurrence of such cases, but the wholesale merchants, too, by being a
little more careful, can do so. And, by the way, does not the very fact
that these traders do get credit from the European merchants show
that they are not, after all, so bad as they are portrayed by you?
If the small European trader has been driven out, is it to be laid
at their door? This shows, it would appear, a grater competency on the
part of the Indian trader in commerce, and this very superior
competency is to be a reason for his expulsion! I ask you, sir, is this
fair? If one editor edited his paper more ably than his rival, and
consequently, drives the latter out of the field, how would the former
like to be told that he should give place to his crestfallen rival because
he (the successful one) was able? Should not the superior ability be a
special reason for encouragement so that the rest may try to rise as
high? Is it a sound policy to stifle healthy competition? Should not
the European trader take a leaf out of the book of the Indian trader, if
that be not below his dignity, and learn how to trade cheaply, how to
live simply? “Do unto  others as you would be done by.”
But you say these wretched Asiatics live a semi-barbaric life. It
would be highly interesting to learn your views of a semi-barbaric life.

without an expensive table-cloth, with no flowers to decorate it, with
no wines spread, no pork or beef ad lib, be a semi-barbaric life; if a
white comfortable dress, specially adapted to a warm climate, which, I
am told, many Europeans envy them in the trying heat of summer, be
a semi barbaric life: if no beer, no tobacco, no ornamental walking-
stick, no golden watch chain, no luxuriously-fitted sitting-room, be a
semi-barbaric life; if, in short, what one commonly understands by a
simple frugal life be a semi-barbaric life, then, indeed, the Indian
traders must plead guilty to the charge, and the sooner the semi-bar-
barity is wiped out from the highest Colonial civilization, the better.
The elements that generally constitute a reason for expulsion of
a people from civilized States are entirely absent in the case of these
people. You will agree when I say that they are not a political danger
to the Government, since they meddle very little, if at all, in politics.
They are not notorious robbers. I believe there is not a single case of
an Indian trader having suffered imprisonment, or even been charged
with theft, robbery, or any of the heinous crimes. (I speak under
correction.) Their teetotal habits make them exceptionally peaceful
citizens.
But they spend nothing, says the leading article under
discussion. Don’t they? I suppose they live on air or sentiments. We
know that Becky lived on nothing for a year in Vanity Fair. And here
a whole class seems to have been found out doing the same. It is to be
presumed they have to pay nothing for shop-rents, taxes, butchers’
bills, grocers’ bills, clerks’ salaries, etc. etc. One would, indeed, like to
belong to such a blessed class of traders, especially in the present
critical condition of the trade all the world over.
It seems, on the whole, that their simplicity, their total abstinence
from intoxicants, their peaceful and, above all, their businesslike and

the bottom of all this contempt and hatred of the poor Indian traders.
And they are British subjects. Is this Christian-like, is this fair play, is
this justice, is this civilization? I pause for a reply.
Thanking you in anticipation for inserting this.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 59, 1, 3, 143746) The elements that generally constitute a reason for expulsion of a people from civilized States are entirely absent in the case of these people.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 61, 3, 4, 147022) TO THE EDITOR The Natal Advertiser
New Para:  SIR,
I have to request your indulgence for inserting the following in
your paper:
To make an exhaustive reply to the programme set forth by you
for the would-be anti-Asiatic league in your issue of the 19th inst. is a
Herculean task, and it cannot be undertaken in the compass of a letter
to a newspaper. I would, however, with your permission, take up only
two items. viz., the fears about “the coolie vote swamping the
European vote”, and the supposed unfitness of the Indians to vote.
At the outset, I would appeal to your good sense, and the love of
fair play which is supposed to be a characteristic of the British nation.
No amount of facts or arguments would convince you or your readers
of the justness of my remarks if you or they are resolved upon
looking at one side only of the question. Cool judgment and a
dispassionate and impartial enquiry are essential to a right view of the
whole matter.
Does it not appear a far-fetched view that the Indian vote can
ever swamp the European vote? A mere superficial observer can see
that such a thing can never happen. A sufficient number can never
command the property qualifications to be able to outdo the
European vote.
They are divided into two classes—the traders and the labourers.
The latter are by far in the majority, and have no votes as a rule.
Poverty-stricken, they come to Natal on starvation wages. Can they
ever dream of having enough property to qualify themselves for
voting? And these are they who live here with any degree of
permanence. Some only of the former class have the property
qualifications; but then they do not live permanently in Natal, and
many of those who can legally vote would never care to do so. The
Indians as a class never, even in their own country, avail themselves of
all their political rights. They are too much taken up with their

have no great political aspirations. They come not to be politicians,
but to earn an honest  bread, and it is a matter for regret if some do
not earn it strictly honestly. So, then, it seems that all the fears about
the Indian vote assuming portentous proportions are ill-grounded.
And even the few votes that the Indians command cannot in any
way affect Natal politics. All talk about an Indian party clamouring
for Indian representation seems to be chimerical, for the selection
would always be between two White men. Would it, then, matter much
that there are some Indian votes? The most the few votes can do will
be to secure them a perfectly White gentleman, who would, if he is
faithful to his promise, do them good service in the Assembly. And
fancy one or two such members making up an Indian party! Why,
they, or rather he, would be a veritable John
1 crying in the wilderness
without his electric, and perhaps I should say divine, power of
converting. Even strong little parties representing diverse minor
interests can effect very little in the Imperial Parliament. They can
only heckle the First Lord with a few questions, and have the
satisfaction of seeing their names appear in the next morning’s
papers.
Then, you think that they (the Indians) are not civilized enough
to be fit for voting; that they may not be any better than the Natives;
and that they are certainly not equal to the Europeans in the scale of
civilization. Perhaps not. And all would depend upon the meaning of
the word “civilization”. It is impossible to enter into a full discussion
of all the questions suggested by an enquiry into the matter. I may,
however, be allowed to point out that they enjoy these privileges in
India. The Queen’s Proclamation of 1858—which is justly and rightly

In these days of cheap publication authors are constantly
multiplying and have naturally lost a great deal of the respect they
used to command before. Let me then at once inform the reader that,
in issuing this little guide I am not aspiring to authorship, but simply
supplying, as I believe, a long-felt want. Issuing guides does not make
authors. They are made of ‘sterner stuff’.
It will be readily admitted that, though Indians have been going
to and returning from England for the last twenty years and more, no
attempt has yet been made at writing a guide like this. Some of them

New Para:  1 The exact date of writing is not available. Pyarelal says: “comparative leisure
at Pretoria enabled Gandhiji to resume two little unfinished ventures which he had
launched while he was in India. One was a little handbook or Guide to London that he
had set about to prepare in answer to numerous inquiries on his return from     
London. . . . It bears the evidence of having been written, at least in part, between the
second half of 1893 and the first half 1894* . . He never published it.” (The Early
Phase, p. 316).
In the introduction, Gandhiji writes: “And here the only topic of conversation
with my visitors has been England till I have been sometimes literally bored (Vol 1:
“Guide to London”; Introduction).” “Here” in this sentence appears to refer to Indian.
It is not known whether the introduction was written before or after the text, but it
may be presumed that the work was commenced before Gandhiji left for South Africa
in 1893* Gandhiji mentions the “morning coat . . . now five years old”, which he
must have bought on reaching London in September 1888; vide Vol 1: “Guide to
London”, chapter II.
About the circumstances in which the MS was located, Pyarelal writes: “The
existing copy was retrieved by me from a heap of papers littering the floor of the
weaving shed in the Satyagraha Ashram at Sabarmati, shortly after my arrival there in
1920* It being shown to Gandhiji, he said that it had been made at his instance by one
of his clerks in South Africa, who wrote a very bad hand, to improve his handwriting.
Unfortunately some pages in the appendix are missing. The original could never be
traced” (E.P*).

New Para:  in England and elsewhere. But they have not gone further. They leave
you in suspense, for they do create in you a desire for going to
England, but how to do it they seem to have failed to tell. Scores of
Indians have become barristers, yet no one has been bold to inform
his countrymen how he managed to live in England. While there I
received many from friends asking me to throw some light on one
thing or another. And here the only topic of conversation with my
visitors has been England till I have been sometimes literally bored.
The avidity with which they have devoured the information must by
itself justify the publication of this unpretentious guide.
No doubt there are many reasons why a book like this has not
been before the public long ago. Any such book in order to be
exhaustive must necessarily contain important revelations which I
know painfully would perhaps stir up a useless controversy and
wrangle and which some would always like not to be made at all. The
movements alike of students and laymen in England are shrouded in
mystery. No one for instance knows definitely what an Indian eats in
England, where he lives; whether he cooks his food or not, etc., etc.
now these are the very points which are of vital importance to those
who intend to go to England. The writer, Therefore, of the following
pages proposes to discover the mystery and lay bare the movements
of Indians in England.
Such a course, I hope, would facilitate to some extent the way to
England in addition to helping the people to understand the England-
returned Indians, but I am afraid it will bring on me showers of
reproaches and remonstrances from many persons. It may even cost
me friendships. Some would call me rash, others would be content
with saying that I lack tact
1, while yet others would fling youth into
my face, but I have resolved upon bearing the storm for the sake of
truth.
The next question is whether I am the person who should write
such a book. I am inclined to leave it to the reader to a great extent to
answer the question. I know there are persons who would tell the same
story in a nobler language, who would tell it with a greater accuracy,
who would tell with a greater fulness and I know also that probably no
one can combine in himself all the qualities. The only reason why I
write the book is that no one has as yet written it though badly wanted.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 66, 2, 8, 159389) CHAPTER 1
New Para:  WHO SHOULD GO TO ENGLAND?
It may be laid down broadly that all who can afford should go
to England. Of course, here the meaning of the word ‘afford’ should
be understood in its widest sense. Thus some cannot go to England
because they cannot afford the money, some cannot afford through
ill-health, others cannot owing to young age and various other
objections. All these will be briefly discussed in the following
paragraphs.
The first and the foremost question is the question of health. No
one with a weak chest or a tendency to consumption should ever think
of going to England. It will simply mean going to England in order to
court death away from friends and relations. It is true that you can go
to the south of Europe not only without injury to the constitution but
with benefit to it; thus you can go to the Riviera and be cured of
consumption. Thousands of consumptive persons annually flock there
to be cured of the fell disease. It is supposed to be one of the finest
places for persons with weak chests; but all this means a great outlay
of money. And then again the book is not written for invalids so that
they may get cured by following the instructions therein contained. It
is written for those with a good health who want to learn and be
useful. Moreover it is for those who would go to England. It is true
also that a person with a generally weak health might take a trip to
England during the summer season without coming to much or any
harm. Still, if I can venture to give an opinion, I should say that those
with any chest disease whatever should never think of going to

New Para:  England except under special circumstances and conditions. On the
other hand, persons suffering from any disease due to a warm climate
can do worse than going to England. I used to suffer from headaches
and nose-bleeding in India. I could not read for three or four hours at
a stretch during the summer months without getting a headache. Now
I am happy to say I am entirely free from both and this I ascribe
mainly to the cold and invigorating climate of England. On there
question of health if there be any doubt about it, it would be best
always to consult some medical authority.
The next question is as to age. It is very difficult to lay down
any hard and fast rules for that. All parents must generally know when
they can part with their children. The solution of the question depends
moreover on the character of the boy who wants to go. Then again it
depends on what he wants to do there. If he wants to pass the Civil
Service examination, the limit of age in now 23* For a person desiring
to be a barrister, he must be twenty-one years before he is called. He
who wants to matriculate must be at least sixteen years old. If you
want to give your child a beginner’s education, you can send it
without a guardian to one of the many homes, where children only are
educated and taken care of.
Having so far dealt with the negative side, I come to the positive.
To lay down broadly that all those who have money, a good
constitution and [are] of proper age should go to England seems very
tempting, but it is not sufficient. All such persons may inquire “Why
should we go to England?” And I venture to answer: for the purposes
of trade, travel or education. Nowadays many go there for education,
some go there for travelling, but very few for trade, though the last is
the most important for the material well-being of the country.
Everyone knows that India wants trade more than anything else and
that England is the best place for getting an insight into different
trades. I do not for a moment hold that a person can learn trading
only in England. What he does learn is the trading habits of the
people. If he wants to extend his commerce with England, the more he
knows the land and their people the better for him, From this it
follows that he should go to England specially for that. Those who go
there for the sake of education or travel do not and cannot make it
their object to study everything relating to trade. There one sees
different branches of commerce in a most efficient state. He sees also
how the large establishments are carried on. A fellow with a trading

again, if we had a direct communication with English gentlemen, we
can dispense with agency. I know there are some Indians who have
established themselves in England and are trading there. This is very
good so far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. I am sorry to say
that the management of these houses is far from satisfactory and
consequently they are not doing a swinging business. I should like
educated traders who have a good knowledge of English to go there,
mix with the people, see the secret of their success and then return to
India, open up branches in England and India in an improved style. I
have been told that we stand a fair chance of doing a good business in
selling carved wood and stones and feathers in England. Everyone
knows how many feathers are daily wasted away in almost every part
of India. Since they are a saleable commodity in Europe, we are
wasting away real wealth simply through sheer ignorance or
indifference. These are mere instances. There must be various other
things which would sell in England. It is exactly because we do not
know these things that we should go to England to learn what they
are. Will a time come when every trading firm will send their man to
England?
Then as to travelling.
Both the traders and students can combine a little travelling with
their profession. These are travellers of a low type. Those who want to
become professional travellers, who want to write books on travels
must go there for the special purpose of travelling. But I believe such
persons had better see their own country first. I cannot do better than

proceed by slow stages, gaining something at every stage and that something
such as to be of immediate practical use at the next stage. When you travel or
study by degrees, every fresh step or item of knowledge is a keen enjoyment.
You are prepared to receive it, and, thus received, your knowledge will fructify.
But when knowledge is thrust upon you without previous discipline, i.e.,
without your being fit for it, it will be inert and unleavened. What is the use of
visiting foreign countries when you know nothing of your own? When you go
to Europe ignorant of your own national life, you will miss those thousand
points of comparison and contrast, those thousand shades of difference, those
thousand beauties and blemishes that modern European civilization presents.

New Para:  outcome of it is that you should begin not at the wrong end.
Last of all comes education. It is with very much regret that I
have to record here that almost all who go to England for the purpose
of education go there in order to become barristers. Education does
not mean becoming barristers. I shall have a good deal to say about
barristers in a separate chapter, so here I shall just say what other
things you can do there. Of course the most coveted examination is
the Civil Service examination. But those only who are British-born
subjects can go in for that examination. Engineering is another
branch of education which you can learn at the Cooper’s Hill College.
You can get the highest  medical degree at the London University. It
has turned out most eminent doctors, but it is a long course and,
though theoretically requiring only five years, requires practically
seven years. Oxford and Cambridge Universities impart a very good
education. They are meant for the richer classes, not the poor. The
education received in these universities is quite different from that
received in the Indian universities. They are not so exacting as our
universities here. Again, in India generally it is all work which, as is
said, “with no play makes Jack a dull boy”. The Oxford and
Cambridge education combines both work and play. That university
life is not a drudgery as I suppose, unfortunately, it is here.
It would be impossible to give exhaustive information about the
various centres of education. They can only be pointed out. The
secretaries of all these institutions can be written to and will send
prospectuses wherefrom every detailed information can be gathered.
Edinburgh too is a place which has become a favourite place with the
Indians, mostly medical students. The medical course there is far
easier than the London course which, of course, is the hardest. The
Durham University, too, gives a medical diploma.
It might be urged that all these things can be had here and at a
less cost. I would admit the former though not the latter. However, the
mere fact that the same thing can be had in India is not sufficient. The
question is which is of superior quality. Is not education in any
branch far superior in  England to that in India? Cannot a man learn
more during the same time in England than in India? The last
proposition is self-evident. A student here is half student and half
man. He may be married too. In that case, he has to think of his wife,
perhaps children, in addition to house-hold cares which an Indian
student is generally saddled with. While, in England, he is alone, no

after, no company to disturb. He is the master of his time. So, if he has
the will, he can do more. Moreover, the invigorating climate in
England is by itself a stimulant to work, the enervating climate of
India is a stimulant to idleness. Who has not passed idle hours in a
summer noon? Who has not wished he had nothing to do in summer
but to sleep? Of course, persons are there who never cease to work in
India. In fact, hardest working students are found in India. But that
work is against the will. In England, it does not do to be idle. You like
the work for the sake of it. You cannot help working. I have heard it
said of a very learned professor that he read as much in three years in
England as he would have in nine years in India. That amount of
work which tells upon one's health in India can be gone through with
ease in England. An instance is at our very doors. Do we not work
more in winter than in summer? So, then, it will not be doubted that a
person willing to work will do more in England than in India. It is
needless to mention the advantage that we have in England of talking
in the English language the whole of our time. It is fervently to be
hoped that examples of persons having cut a sorry figure will not be
cited in refutation of the above proposition. For such fall under the

types of learning from England. There are the better opportunities, it
is for you to avail of them. If you do not, you are to blame, not
England. And if superior education can be obtained in England, it
follows that it is not more expensive than that to be obtained in India,

the amount, let him make absolutely sure of getting the full amount in
England. In certain cases it may be advisable to take the whole
amount with him. I know by personal experience how even persons
who have promised on oath to give some pecuniary assistance, a loan

depend upon prove false to their promises.

often find persons who would give you a loan even. The loan too is
generally big, for when you do not get the promised money, it is not a
small sum, but a tolerably large one which you would not expect any
friend to lend. I know by personal experience and that of friends what
it is for an Indian to be without money even for a moment in
England. It involves an extra expense of wiring home, not to speak of
the anxieties one has to suffer under such circumstances, and wiring to
India is very expensive. It is four shillings per word. Therefore be sure
you will get a sufficient amount of money and that, too, at the proper
time.
Then, if possible, it is always advisable to get some introduction
notes to gentlemen in England. They are not absolutely necessary, but
when you can get them, they are not useless. You know that you will

New Para:  To buy the above things care must be taken that the best things
are bought at the cheapest prices and that the things bought are
suitable. . . There are many shops in Bombay. Some of the native
shops are very good. The English shops would be found to be very
expensive. Whenever practicable, it is always best to get some
experienced person to buy the things for you.
It may not be useless here to make a few remarks on the above
list. Two trunks have been mentioned in the list and the price for both
has been put down at Rs* 16/-. Each trunk may be 26x12
1* Generally
they buy one steel trunk and a leather bag. And one of th0e best steel
trunks would cost Rs* 25 and a leather bag—a gladstone bag—would
cost much the same. This expense is not necessary. A good trunk can
be bought for Rs* 12* In putting down the price at Rs* 16 I have in my
mind native iron trunks which are as strong as, if not stronger than, the
steel trunks. That would be an encouragement to native industry and a
saving of a few rupees to the purchaser. If the native trunks do not suit
or if they cannot be had, wooden boxes can be bought or imitation
steel trunks which do not cost more than Rs* 5 each. The P* & O* rules
say with regard to the size of the trunks:

New Para:  The portmanteau for cabin use should not exceed 3 ft in length, 1 ft 9
inches in width and 1 ft and 3 inches in depth. No packages exceeding this
limit are allowed in the saloons or cabins.
The prices for other articles are not by any means the lowest
prices. For example, while I have put down 1/2 rupee for a pair of
socks, a good pair can be had for 5 or 6 annas. If good woollen socks
cannot be had in Bombay, they may be bought in London. For six
socks would answer the purpose in the boat. With the clothing
mentioned in the above list one need not spend anything on dress for
a year in England. A further list of clothing will be given later on. It
may be bought in England if it is found necessary. And that would
give one more than enough clothing for a 3 years' stay in England.
Certain things that are generally included in such lists have been
purposely left out, e.g., towels, soap, etc. These things can be had
gratis on board. Foreign stamps can be bought on board.
As to what dress to wear on board, it is best to begin with the
jacket suit. It is not at all necessary to wear the undervest or the
drawers. They should be made use of only when the cold weather has
begun. It is always advisable not to overload oneself with dress. I have
come across many persons who have suffered from over-clothing. Of
course, it is equally necessary not to underclothe. The undervest and
drawers would not be required till the steamer reaches Port Said, for,
the weather to be met with from Bombay to Port Said is not less warm
than that we experience in India. If cold is felt after leaving Port Said,
the cotton underclothing may be worn or, if necessary, the woollen
underclothing. Till Brindisi is reached the overcoat may not be
touched at all. It must be understood that this is not the condition in
which all can live. No hard and fast rules can be laid down for
clothing. The above remarks have been made simply to remove the
generally prevalent idea that the under-clothing and the over  coat are
absolutely necessary as soon as the steamer leaves the harbour. The
safest thing to do is to begin to wear more and warmer clothes
according to necessity.
The white shirts have almost been left out. This may be
considered a hardship not because they are a climatic necessity but
because they are a fashion. Well, this is a book meant for those who
want to live cheaply and yet respectably. One can safely break
through fashion especially when it is expensive and injurious, but the
process should not be gone through violently. The white shirts have

great extent. A white shirt would cost 4d to wash while a flannel shirt
would cost only 2d. Again, while one flannel shirt per week is
sufficient, at least two white shirts would hardly answer the purpose.
They

Indeed, 
some
unconventional gentlemen in England who have ceased adoring the
fashion as a goddess have discarded stiff clothing altogether. They
have bidden goodbye to the stiff collars, cuffs and the shirts. Even
medical opinion has begun to revolt against too much use of starch
which is absolutely necessary for washing white shirts. The starch has
been pronounced to be injurious to the body. Whatever it is, there is
no denying the fact that flannel shirts are more comfortable and, in
the end, less expensive than linen shirts.
 However, if the fashion is to be adored as it ought to be more or
less, if you are not to break through it violently, wear the flannel shirts
without collars; use the white collars and cuffs and you would lead
others to believe that you have white shirts on. This trick is resorted to
by thousands in London and sometimes it is very convenient. And, if
at times, you like to look a London swell, that too has been provided
for. A white shirt would be found mentioned in the list and may be
used occasionally.
As a token of respect to the fashion goddess, the neckties too
have not been forgotten. They will find a place in the further list.
They might be used or not according to one's fancies. They do not
cost much if bought cheaply.
The morning coat is worn on visits. On board, too, if you are a
first-saloon passenger, it is a necessity. As far as possible, you should
wear the jacket suit so that the morning coat may not be spoiled. The
writer of these pages had only one morning coat. It is now five years
old and yet looks as new as if it were made yesterday. As soon as it is
done with, brush it well, fold it and put it in your chest of drawers and
it would never spoil.
Shaving materials are mentioned in the list. Do not be surprised.
You shall not be a professional barber. But you will have to shave
yourself if you have a beard. Even kings are not ashamed of so doing
in Europe. If  you have thick hair, you have to shave every day. It is a
trouble to be at the mercy of a barber every day and incur an expense
of at least 2d. To save that it is necessary to learn how to shave
oneself. It does not take long. Only a few minutes spent for three or
four days would be found sufficient.

New Para:  For head-dress the turkish cap is mentioned. This is very handy.
But, for one who feels uncomfortable in the cap and does not like to
be noticed by people, a felt-hat is mentioned in the second list that is
to follow.
For tooth powder the best (medically) and yet the cheapest
powder is precipitated chalk. You can get 4 oz. for 6d. This will last
for months.
Slippers are to be worn at home and on board only.
There is another item of dress that has been left out from the
list. It is the dress suit. Now this is not at all necessary. Although many
Indians buy it, it is not advisable to incur that expense. I bought it
myself and am very sorry for it. I wore it but three or four times. I
consider that to be the most foolish expense I incurred in England.
They wear it for evening parties. We Indians can wear the morning
coat or the Parsee coat or our own native dress whatever that may be. I
have seen many Indians wearing the morning coat. There is nothing
wrong in it. You have to look clean and tidy, nothing more.
A watch has not been mentioned in the list. For, it has become
an article of everyday wear among the educated Indians.
The second list will be found in the 4th chapter. The articles
contained in it are to be bought in England. No one should go
beyond the list unless he uses his clothes very carelessly and, if one
goes to England to become or remain careless, might it not be said, he
had better not go at all. The two lists include more than ordinarily
required clothing for an ordinarily careful man for three years.
The next thing that  one has to do is to buy the passage. Three
things are to be considered before buying it, viz. :
1*  What month to start in.
2*  Whether to go all the way by sea or via Brindisi.
3*  Whether to go by the P* & O* boats or any other Company's.
As to the first question, while one can start in any month, all
things considered the middle of March is the best season. Thereby
one avoids immediate experience of English winter and, before he
meets with the bitter cold, he will have six beautiful months, viz., from
April to September. April is the depth of spring and September the
beginning of autumn. Before he has the first experience of an English
winter, he will have been acclimatized and accustomed to the English
ways of living. He would thus be able to bear the winter with a greater
equanimity. Moreover by starting in March, one gets the mildest

New Para:  weather in the Red Sea. And even the mildest weather of the Red Sea
is most trying. In summer, although only 3 days have to be spent on
the Red Sea, it is unbearable. The heat is suffocating. No use of
punkhas and ice is sufficient to allay the burning sensation. It is a time
of perpetual perspiration. Moreover, in March the sea all the way is
the calmest in the year.
The next best time is September or October. By leaving at that
time, of course, you have to brave the winter as soon as you reach
England, but if you want to become a Barrister, you have this
consolation that you would be able to return home three months
earlier than by starting in any other month. This will be treated more
fully in the chapter for would-be Barristers.
Having selected the season, one has to consider what would be
the best thing to do—whether to go all the way by sea or via Brindisi.
It takes nearly 22 days by the P & O boats to reach London and 13
days to reach Brindisi, whence London is reached in 2 days by rail. It
seems that it is much better to take the sea route throughout. Thereby
all the inconveniences of removing luggage and having it examined,
etc., are avoided and all the comforts to be found in P & O boats are
enjoyed for a longer time. Moreover, a long voyage is very good for
health. Some remain on the seas for months for the sake of health
only. It is, therefore, advisable that one should take the sea voyage
when especially it causes a saving of expense. The second-saloon fare
to London by sea is Rs* 370, while via Brindisi it is more than Rs* 400*
Those who get sea-sick very often need not be afraid of a sea voyage
on that  score. For during the 13 days for Brindisi one gets used to the
sea and overcomes the sickness. It is to be hoped that no one would
avoid the voyage from Brindisi for the reason that thereby he would
be less open to the dangers of a wreck. This is an idea unworthy of
one intending to go to England. It must be remembered that he would
be one out of many in his steamer. There are dangers even on the
railway. In fact, nowhere is life without dangers. It is a question
merely of degree.
The next question to be decided is what Company’s boat to go
by. There is a very wide field for selection. There the City, Hall, Clan,
etc., steamers. But by far the best and most popular are the Peninsular
and Oriental Company’s boats, which carry Her Majesty’s mails to
London. The other lines are a trifle cheaper than the last mentioned
and, if anyone chooses to book his passage on any of the above lines,

fixed rates for these lines. However, whenever practicable, P & O boats
should be  preferred. The passage can be booked through Messrs
King and Co., or Messrs Thomas Cook & Sons at Bombay who are
always obliging and ready to supply every information. They do not
charge any commission.
Whether to take the 1st-saloon or the 2nd-saloon ticket, very
much depends upon one's purse. As to comforts, there is not much
difference. Of course, a 1st-saloon passenger gets better company and
better food. The food, however, given in the 2nd-saloon is good
enough. And, especially, a vegetarian should not incur the expenses of
a 1st-saloon passage. The main difference is in food and, since a
vegetarian would not take flesh meat, for him the 1st-saloon expense
would be entirely unnecessary. The second saloon by sea costs Rs*
370, while the 1st saloon costs Rs* 680* A second-saloon passage via
Brindisi including 2nd-class railway ticket costs Rs* 445 and a first-
class railway ticket costs Rs* 500, while a first saloon with 1st-class
railway ticket costs Rs* 810* First-saloon passengers are allowed on
board 336 lb. of personal luggage free of freight and the second-
saloon passengers 168 lb.
A few remarks about food, etc., on board would not be out of
place here. For those who do not object to meat, nothing specially
need be mentioned here except everything one can wish for can
ordinarily be had on the steamer. The only complaint that can be
urged against the Company in respect of food is that the passengers
are over-fed. From morning till evening or, even as late as eleven
o'clock, one can get something to eat at short intervals. As early as six
or seven o'clock, you get biscuits and tea or coffee. At 8*30 a.m. you
get breakfast consisting of oatmeal porridge, jam, marmalade, bread,
butter, salad, meat and potatoes ad libitum. At 1 p.m. you get a good
dinner consisting of meat, potatoes and cabbage, some sweet, bread,
butter, etc., and twice in a week fruits and nuts. At 4 p.m. you can
have a cup of tea and biscuits. Again at 6 p.m. a nice supper
consisting of salad, cheese, bread, butter, jam, marmalade, tea, cocoa,
etc., is provided and, as a finishing stroke, just at the time of going to
bed, you can replenish the hungry stomach with biscuits and cheese.
All this to an Indian would sound very strange and look like gluttony.

above dishes for some time. Though, after some time, he would find
that all the dishes are very nice and nutritious. As a precaution, it
would be better to keep a stock of some fresh fruits and sweets, e.g.,
 jalebi, halva, etc., and some salty things, e.g., ganthia
1, etc. These
with English dishes now and then would quite suffice. Care should be
taken that English dishes are increased and the quantity of native
things taken decreased. Such a gradual change would be effected
imperceptibly and without affecting the constitution. The things to be
found on board for a vegetarian are bread, butter, milk, fruit, nuts,
jam, marmalade, rice, cheese, potatoes, cabbage, salad, cakes, tea,
coffee, biscuits and porridge. This is really a large variety out of
which many meals containing quite distinct articles can be made.
Nothing can be more nutritious than porridge, bread and butter and a
cup of cocoa or if you like tea. For dinner you can have one course
of bread, butter and vegetables, another course of rice, milk and jam
(a sweet preparation) and a third course of some fruit or bread and
cheese. You can make a very good supper of bread, butter and cocoa
and jam and salad or cheese or both. If these be not sufficient, special
arrangements are made for vegetarians. The chief steward should be
informed and requested to prepare some vegetable dishes and he very
obligingly gets for you vegetable curry, fresh fruit and stewed fruit
and brown bread. And you cannot want anything more. Some
interesting facts would be found from the appendix as to how the
writer of these pages managed on board.
2 If a pious Indian does not
want to eat food cooked by Europeans, he can cook his own food in
the Indian quarters, where they would give a space for cooking.
Whether this is advisable or not is quite another matter. This is
mentioned just to remove the prevailing prejudice to the effect that on
board one has no other course open but to take food cooked by the
Europeans.
The much-vexed and important question whether it is possible
to remain a vegetarian on board and in England will be discussed in
another chapter. It is sufficient to mention for the present purposes
that it is not at all necessary to take meat or wine and it is positively
injurious to take the latter.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 5, 188876) These with English dishes now and then would quite suffice.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 6, 188936) Care should be taken that English dishes are increased and the quantity of native things taken decreased.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 7, 189042) Such a gradual change would be effected imperceptibly and without affecting the constitution.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 8, 189136) The things to be found on board for a vegetarian are bread, butter, milk, fruit, nuts, jam, marmalade, rice, cheese, potatoes, cabbage, salad, cakes, tea, coffee, biscuits and porridge.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 9, 189322) This is really a large variety out of which many meals containing quite distinct articles can be made.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 10, 189425) Nothing can be more nutritious than porridge, bread and butter and a cup of cocoa or if you like tea.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 11, 189527) For dinner you can have one course of bread, butter and vegetables, another course of rice, milk and jam (a sweet preparation) and a third course of some fruit or bread and cheese.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 12, 189708) You can make a very good supper of bread, butter and cocoa and jam and salad or cheese or both.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 13, 189804) If these be not sufficient, special arrangements are made for vegetarians.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 14, 189879) The chief steward should be informed and requested to prepare some vegetable dishes and he very obligingly gets for you vegetable curry, fresh fruit and stewed fruit and brown bread.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 15, 190062) And you cannot want anything more.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 16, 190097) Some interesting facts would be found from the appendix as to how the writer of these pages managed on board.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 17, 190207) 2 If a pious Indian does not want to eat food cooked by Europeans, he can cook his own food in the Indian quarters, where they would give a space for cooking.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 18, 190366) Whether this is advisable or not is quite another matter.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 19, 190424) This is mentioned just to remove the prevailing prejudice to the effect that on board one has no other course open but to take food cooked by the Europeans.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 20, 190581) The much-vexed and important question whether it is possible to remain a vegetarian on board and in England will be discussed in another chapter.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 79, 1, 21, 190727) It is sufficient to mention for the present purposes that it is not at all necessary to take meat or wine and it is positively injurious to take the latter.

New Para:  Having landed in London, where to go seems to present some
difficulty. The editor of The Vegetarian, a newspaper published in
London Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, has kindly consented to
give the necessary directions and find them the proper lodgings where
they can have everything cheap and nice. Here I may be allowed to
say a word about The Vegetarian. It is a paper which I believe should
be subscribed to by every Indian who would see Englishmen as
vegetarians and who would sympathize with the movement now going
on in London. It should be bought not especially as mental food, not
for the sake of the information given by it, not for the high-class
intellectual matter contained in it, though these are by no means of an
inferior quality, but for encouraging a movement every Indian should
have at heart. To return, however, to the main subject, the people of
the London Vegetarian Society are always kind and hospitable
towards Indians and a more genial man than the editor of The
Vegetarian it would be difficult to find. It would, therefore, be a great
gain for every Indian going to England to let the editor know of his
so doing. I may perhaps  suggest, though the suggestion has nothing
whatever to do with the editor, that in common fairness every such
person would subscribe himself as a member of the Society or
subscribe to the paper.
But, if the above arrangement be not deemed feasible or
advisable, the next best thing to do would be put up at the Vegetarian
Hotel, Charing Cross, be he a vegetarian or meat-eater. A list
1 of
houses would be found at the end of the book wherefrom to make a
selection. The terms in the appendix places are very reasonable. Other
hotels would be found very dear. On landing, a cab can always be had
which would take you, on your giving the name, to the place named.
These lodgings, it must be understood, are only temporary until a
permanent one is found. So the next thing to do would be to search
for a good and suitable room. This can be done in the company of
some friend whom you may be knowing or to whom you have got an
introduction note.

seriously is to differ from everybody. Every man would furnish his
own estimates, thinking at the same time that no other estimates could
be true and, if true, possible for everyone. That again is the question
which is the most important, especially, to a man of ordinary
circumstances. And it is strange that, although the question is
admittedly of such a vast importance, greater ignorance does not
prevail with regard to any question ordinarily presenting itself to an
Indian wishing to go to England than with regard to this. It is
moreover true that the ordinary estimates quoted are from 10 to 20
pounds per month. Living on £10 per month was pronounced to be
very economical. With such estimates to say that one can live
comfortably on £4 a month or £1 a week could be a heresay:
Nevertheless, it is a fact beyond doubt, as shall be proved just now, that
it is possible to live on one pound a week and that many have lived on
less. I may say that I have tried the experiment successfully and was
never happier than under the £4 living. While I was living on £4 per
month, I had to work the hardest. The reader will find from (App. A)
how, from £12 per month, I gradually came down to £4 per month.
First of all, I shall consider the cost of lodgings. It is commonly
supposed that a student should have two rooms, one bed-room and
one sitting-room. Now this is quite useless except to show, that you are
very rich and can afford to spend any amount of money. This guide
is not written for those who would make a show very often false, of
their riches. It is written for those who would live a regular student's
life, as economical as possible. There are many professional
gentlemen-bachelors living in one room only. Of course, there are
many Indian students and thousands of English students living in one
room only. Two rooms are more for families than for students. Then
if you have one room only with the necessary furniture in a good
quarter, it can be had for 7s per week and less. Of course, one room
can be had for 2s per week. I give low estimates. Such rooms can be
had in North London, West, Central, West Kensington, Westbourne
Park, and many other respectable parts of London commonly
favoured by Indian students. In such a room you would find a table,
three or four chairs, an easy chair, a wash-stand with all the requisites,
a hearth, a chest of drawers, probably a book-case, cupboard, a carpet,
a bedstead with bed-sheets and blankets, a looking-glass, etc. Are
Indian students used to better-furnished rooms? Indeed, a raw Indian
not used to the two rooms would be quite enchanted with such a room

As to bathing, it is only in the newly-built houses that bathrooms

tumblers of hot water always to be supplied at your request by the
landlady in the morning. You can pour water into your basin, dip a
sponge in it and rub hard with the sponge twice or thrice and then rub
the body with a dry towel, and you have taken a very nice bath which
gives a glow to the body and keeps it clean. Even the sponge may be
left out and the hands only used. To these daily baths may be added a
fortnightly or monthly visit to the public baths. Your landlady
supplies you with two towels every week. All these arrangements must

It is not true to say, as is commonly supposed, that owing to the
severe cold one cannot take baths daily. On the other hand, it is
necessary that one should bathe daily in order to keep good health. A
landlady, I know, drove away her boarder simply because he would
not take his daily bath. She often used to quote: “Cleanliness is next
to godliness”, and, no matter how cold it was, she used to see every
morning that everyone in her house had a bath.
Next to bathing come travelling expenses, which should not
amount to more than 6d per week. By having your room in the
neighbourhood of the place to be most frequented by you, you avoid
the daily expense of travelling to the place, but on Sundays you may
visit friends and spend a few pence in travelling. Of course, one week
you may spend a shilling if need be and not spend anything the next
week. It is always best, whenever possible, to walk so that you may
have exercise at the same time that you save the money. Nothing can
be better. Many do this purposely in England, not so much for the
sake of saving a few pence, as for the sake of exercise. Walking three
or four miles is a pleasure in the cold climate of England. Indeed,
whenever it is possible in the cold weather, a brisk walk should be
preferred to a ride in a train or a bus. Very often the latter proves
injurious. I was once literally stiff in a bus. Even the bus conductors
recognize the danger. At intervals they run with the bus and get into it
when they are warm.
Six pence per week on an average may be set apart for stamps,
etc., though such sum is hardly necessary.
If you have your hair cut twice every month, it would cost you
8d, so that 2d per week may be put down for hair-cutting. Of course,
you shave yourself.
One cake of Pear's soap would last a month. It costs 31/2 d. So
then 1 d per week may be allowed for soap.
One penny per week may be set aside for tooth powder. This is
rather extravagant. You can have a very fine and harmless tooth
powder  in precipitated chalk, four ounces of which can be had for 6
d. And an ounce would last you quite a month instead of a week.
There is one big item of expenditure that should not be lost
sight of. In winter, fire is required in the room during the day time if

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 6, 198573) A landlady, I know, drove away her boarder simply because he would not take his daily bath.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 7, 198665) She often used to quote: “Cleanliness is next to godliness”, and, no matter how cold it was, she used to see every morning that everyone in her house had a bath.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 8, 198827) Next to bathing come travelling expenses, which should not amount to more than 6d per week.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 9, 198919) By having your room in the neighbourhood of the place to be most frequented by you, you avoid the daily expense of travelling to the place, but on Sundays you may visit friends and spend a few pence in travelling.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 10, 199133) Of course, one week you may spend a shilling if need be and not spend anything the next week.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 11, 199227) It is always best, whenever possible, to walk so that you may have exercise at the same time that you save the money.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 12, 199345) Nothing can be better.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 13, 199368) Many do this purposely in England, not so much for the sake of saving a few pence, as for the sake of exercise.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 14, 199480) Walking three or four miles is a pleasure in the cold climate of England.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 15, 199554) Indeed, whenever it is possible in the cold weather, a brisk walk should be preferred to a ride in a train or a bus.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 16, 199671) Very often the latter proves injurious.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 17, 199711) I was once literally stiff in a bus.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 18, 199748) Even the bus conductors recognize the danger.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 19, 199794) At intervals they run with the bus and get into it when they are warm.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 20, 199865) Six pence per week on an average may be set apart for stamps, etc., though such sum is hardly necessary.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 21, 199970) If you have your hair cut twice every month, it would cost you 8d, so that 2d per week may be put down for hair-cutting.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 22, 200091) Of course, you shave yourself.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 23, 200122) One cake of Pear's soap would last a month.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 24, 200166) It costs 31/2 d.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 25, 200183) So then 1 d per week may be allowed for soap.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 26, 200229) One penny per week may be set aside for tooth powder.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 27, 200283) This is rather extravagant.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 28, 200311) You can have a very fine and harmless tooth powder in precipitated chalk, four ounces of which can be had for 6 d.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 29, 200426) And an ounce would last you quite a month instead of a week.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 30, 200487) There is one big item of expenditure that should not be lost sight of.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 83, 1, 31, 200558) In winter, fire is required in the room during the day time if

New Para:  you use the room. For those who use the library in the case of stude
nts, the expense does not amount to much. But for others, it amounts
to nearly 2 shillings per week. For 2 shillings you can get 4 scuttles
coal. But, as fire is not required generally from April to September, we
may put down on an average one shilling per week for coals.

summed up :

With 7s for the room rent and 4s for extras we have 9s
remaining for food. It may here be remarked that a saving can be
effected even in the 11s, whenever required, so that it may be spent on
food or buying books and many other useful things. Thus, for
instance, out of 6d for stamps, etc., only a penny or two may be spent.
One penny, I suppose, would be absolutely necessary for writing
home a postcard. Fortnightly baths (in winter especially) may take the
place of weekly baths when a sponge bath is taken daily. Similarly, at
times, nothing may be spent in travelling. It is an expense to be
counted, not necessary to be incurred. The aim ought to be not to
spend more than one pound per week on  an average and live
comfortably.
Passing now from this comparatively incontestable part of the
question of the cost of living, we reach the most important and
contestable part of the question, viz., the cost of food.
There is so much to be said on this part of the subject, so much
prejudice and misunderstanding to be removed that to treat the subject
fully would require a separate and larger book.

New Para:  How to get good, nutritious, healthy and palatable food for 9s
per week is the question before us.
 At the outset I may say that those only can live on that sum who
“eat to live”, not “live to eat”. If you must have the luxuries, if you
cannot sit at the table without company, if you must entertain friends
pretty frequently to sumptuous dinners, if you must live like a
gourmand, then for you ten times the sum may not be sufficient. But
if you would live frugally and happily and not luxuriously, 9s per
week would be more than sufficient.
I earnestly beseech the reader to dismiss from his mind all
premeditated ideas, all prejudice, and he will, I am sure, see for himself
that without entailing any loss of health, but rather keeping it up, he
would find 9s sufficient for his food per week.
As nothing tells like illustrations, I would first cite illustrations in
support of the contention that one pound a week is sufficient for a
person of frugal habits and not born in the lap of luxury or rather not
addicted to a luxurious mode of living. There are thousands of
commercial gentlemen living on one pound a week in England. I had
a chat with an Anglo-Indian here who said that he was living on one
pound a week. There is a gentleman who is an M.A*, B.E.L*, Barrister-
at-Law, who lived on 10s a week and has yet been living on less than
one pound a week. He is the editor of a newspaper and I have seen
him work at the rate of 16 hours or more per diem. He was, when I
saw him last, living on bread, figs and water.
There are Irish M.P*”s living on one pound per week. And
some of them are the best debaters. The late Mr* Biggor, M.P*, I
believe, lived on one pound a week.
And what did Charles Bradlaugh do? Says Mrs* Annie Besant of
him:

New Para:  He sold everything he possessed except his books. His home that he
had got together by hard work, his furniture, even a diamond ring given to him
by a grateful person whom he had helped. He sent his children to school. His
wife, not physically able to bear the life he faced, went to live with her parents
in the country and he took two small rooms in Turner Street, White Chapel, for
which he paid 3s 6d a week and where he remained until he had cleared off most
of his liabilities. He then moved to lodgings over a music shop in Circus
Road, St* John's Wood, where he lived for the remainder of his life, his
daughters joining him on the death of their mother in 1877* . . . He died poor
indeed with no personal property save his library, his Indian gifts and his very
modest wardrobe, but he left his name free, his honour unstained.

concerned, his  food did not cost Cardinal Manning more than nine

New Para:  There are, to take a noted and living example, few harder working men
in England than Archbishop Manning, a man full of cares and labours, yet I am
assured by those who have had the most intimate personal relations with him
that Mr* Disraeli in 'Lothair' has not in the least exaggerated his habitual
abstinence and that his ordinary meal, in public or private, is a biscuit or a bit
of bread and a glass of water.
His strict abstinence from wines is notorious.
Dr* Nichols from whose work the above has been taken did not,
and probably does not, spend more than 6d a day on food. (3s 6d per
week). He has written a book How to Live on Six Pence a Day, a book
everybody who would live frugally ought to read. In it he relates his
experiment with the most gratifying results.
There are many other books written on the subject. There is a
book entitled How to Live on One Pound a Week. This includes
everything, lodging, food, clothes, etc.
Indeed, a gentleman has even tried to limit his food expenses to
one shilling a week and written a book on the subject. We however
allow nine times the sum for food.
All these instances must suffice to show that, not only is it
possible to live on £1 a week, but many have done it.
Has any Indian done it, some may ask? Yes, a gentleman, a
judge from the Punjab, while I was in England came there, for a
Barrister's education on furlough. He was over 40 years of age and
was with his son in England. He said his pay was Rs* 150* He gave, he
said, Rs* 50 to his wife at home and spent Rs* 50 for himself and his
boy in London. That amounted to £3˙1/3 per month, i.e., less than £1
per week for two souls. This small sum was made to include many
things besides those that we allow for one pound.
Another Indian gentleman from Gujarat was living on less than
10s per week and seemed to be quite happy. He shared a room for 4s
with a friend and thus got his accommodation for 2s only. This
gentleman has been receiving medical education in England. Sadhu
Narayan Hemchandra has been living on one pound a week.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 87, 1, 8, 207680) A gentleman who has recently gone to England writes thus to me:
New Para:  From my last letter you might have thought very badly of me because I
myself look upon my conduct at the time with little satisfaction. But, as you
wanted to know how I was living, I had to give you my sincere views. Since
that time a great change has been brought about by degrees. What I thought an
impossibility at that time is now a practical possibility. Six pounds a month
are a thing of the past, and you will wonder to hear that, even in London, I am
able to limit my board and lodging expenses to three pounds per month.
With this array of facts before the reader, I hope he will have no
difficulty in following and agreeing with me that, if one has the will,
one can live on one pound a week and even less in England.
Now we come to the solution of the question how to live on 9s a
week.
In the first place it may be mentioned that, to live so cheaply, all
the luxuries ought to be avoided, viz., tea, coffee, tobacco and wines
and, last but not least, flesh foods.
There are people to tell you that it is impossible to do without
tea in England. Some say you cannot do without coffee, others say
you would die without tobacco, wines or meat. All these gentlemen

difference of opinion as to flesh foods. As to the rest, every Indian
who has gone to England would tell you that not one of them is
necessary except for the sake of pleasure of luxury. However what do
they think of tea and coffee in London? Says Dr* Nichols about tea
and coffee:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 87, 2, 9, 207744) From my last letter you might have thought very badly of me because I myself look upon my conduct at the time with little satisfaction.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 87, 2, 10, 207880) But, as you wanted to know how I was living, I had to give you my sincere views.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 87, 2, 11, 207961) Since that time a great change has been brought about by degrees.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 87, 2, 12, 208027) What I thought an impossibility at that time is now a practical possibility.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 87, 2, 13, 208104) Six pounds a month are a thing of the past, and you will wonder to hear that, even in London, I am able to limit my board and lodging expenses to three pounds per month.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 87, 2, 14, 208274) With this array of facts before the reader, I hope he will have no difficulty in following and agreeing with me that, if one has the will, one can live on one pound a week and even less in England.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 87, 2, 15, 208472) Now we come to the solution of the question how to live on 9s a week.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 87, 2, 16, 208542) In the first place it may be mentioned that, to live so cheaply, all the luxuries ought to be avoided, viz., tea, coffee, tobacco and wines and, last but not least, flesh foods.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 87, 2, 17, 208720) There are people to tell you that it is impossible to do without tea in England.

New Para:  health of the system. Tea and coffee are stimulants only and their influence
upon the body is either inappreciable or hurtful. Strong decoctions of either
stimulate the brain and nerves, produce over-action and, by combating fatigue
for a time, allows us to over-task our powers until we bring on dyspepsia,
neuralgia, softening of the brain, paralysis, apoplexy.
A distinguished Indian doctor of considerable experience, while
talking about tea, said that he refused to treat patients who would not
leave off tea under his treatment. However, if tea and coffee are to be
taken, they would not mean so much more expense as so much less
nutritive food. For they will be substituted for milk which is far better
than tea or coffee. From a pecuniary point of view, a cup of tea or
coffee made at home would cost less than a glass of milk. If tea is to
be taken, it would be better to use condensed milk as it would be
difficult to buy milk sufficient only for one or two cups of tea, unless
only milk is used for making tea.
As to tobacco, it is positively injurious to the system and an
expensive luxury which does no good and a great deal of harm.
Tobacco, it must be known, is very dear in England. If it is indulged
in, six pence would be ordinarily required daily. It cost an Indian
gentleman £30 during his three years' stay. A good cigar costs 4 to 6d
and a cigarette 1d each. One can get 5 cigarettes for a penny, but this
is the dirtiest stuff possible. It contains either ashes of tobacco or
cabbage leaves. So in order to be able to live well on £1 a week, it is
absolutely necessary to [abstain from]
1 tobacco which “whether
chewed or smoked or snuffed has no nutritive property but is an acrid
poison, absorbed into the blood and resting upon the brain and
nerves, first exciting and then dulling their sensibility and finally
stupefying and paralysing.”
Thus hatefully does Count Tolstoy, than whom “few men have
been more given to wine and cigarettes”, speak of both:

New Para:  For the more a man stupefies himself with these stimulants, narcotics,
the more stolid, quiescent and stagnant he become intellectually and morally.
We all know what deeds are committed by men in a drunken state.
As to the wines, the above quotations are sufficient to show what
a man who used to drink fearfully thinks of them. It is not necessary
to quote extracts to prove that wines are injurious and that we are not
required to drink wines in England. There are hundred of societies to
convince you of the fact that wines are not necessary. There are many
members of Parliament who do not drink at all. In fact, there in a
teetotalers party in the Commons, with which are prominently
associated the names W.S* Caine and Sir Wilfred Lawson. We have
temperance societies in Bombay and many parts of India. There are
even Anglo-Indians who are teetotalers. In spite of all this, persons
there are, enlightened by then, who believe and refuse to disbelieve,
even though convinced, that wines are absolutely necessary in
England. A gentleman said: “After reaching England, you may not
require them, but somewhere in the Mediterranean sea, I am told you
die without them.” He was told, I may be allowed to tell him that if
the wines were so very necessary, the P* & O* Company would provide
wines together with the food for the fees they charge and not make
the passengers pay separately for the wines they consume. If the wines
were to be  taken in England, and that regularly, 9s would be used up
simply in drinking and it would be impossible to make the two ends
meet for the estimate given by me.
So, then, it is absolutely necessary to exclude wines and tobacco
from the estimate and advisable to exclude tea and coffee, as the latter
can be used at a sacrifice of far more substantial drink: milk.
Now we come to the question of flesh foods which, I think, must
be abandoned if 9s are to be sufficient so as not to injure health. How
would the Mahommedans and Parsis do, it may be asked in that case.

They are free to take meat whenever they can get it, e.g., in their Inn if

Diseases may be conveyed by both sources of supply, but need not

New Para:  Under a properly constituted fruit and vegetable diet, strength of mind
and body may be as fully secured as under an animal or a mixed animal and
vegetable system. He says also, “I admit that some of the best work has been
done and is being done on a vegetarian regimen.”
If so much is conceded by a thoughtful and cautious doctor not
a vegetarian, the reader will easily guess how much must be claimed
by vegetarians for their system. They claim that anatomically,
physiologically, economically and morally vegetarianism is far
superior to meat-eating.
From this it must be abundantly clear that vegetarianism is not
only possible, but is really practised by hundreds of people in
England.
If, then, vegetarianism be as shown above as good as flesh-eating
in other respects, I hope no man, not determined upon setting his face
against vegetarianism at any cost, would hesitate to adopt it if it is
cheaper than flesh-eating.
While a vegetable soup costs 3 d per plate, a meat soup costs
from 9 d to 1/3s and more. A mutton chop would cost at least three
times as much as a vegetable chop, unless you go in for meat of the
worst kind, and it must be borne in mind that there are more diseases
lurking in cheap meat than in vegetables.
It would be futile for me to demonstrate an admitted fact, viz.,
that vegetarianism costs far less than meat-eating. If there be anyone
who can contradict this, let him try to live on 9s per week and get flesh
foods. I concede that, by a judicious management, it would be
possible to have in that sum, if anyone thinks that he must have, not as
a luxury but as a sheer medical necessity, meat once or twice a week.
Another fact is worth mentioning here. An ordinary vegetarian
in England does not exclude eggs from his dietary, while an Indian
vegetarian would. As a counterpart, there are vegetarians in England

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 91, 4, 6, 218012) Under a properly constituted fruit and vegetable diet, strength of mind and body may be as fully secured as under an animal or a mixed animal and vegetable system.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 91, 4, 7, 218176) He says also, “I admit that some of the best work has been done and is being done on a vegetarian regimen.” If so much is conceded by a thoughtful and cautious doctor not a vegetarian, the reader will easily guess how much must be claimed by vegetarians for their system.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 91, 4, 8, 218448) They claim that anatomically, physiologically, economically and morally vegetarianism is far superior to meat-eating.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 91, 4, 9, 218566) From this it must be abundantly clear that vegetarianism is not only possible, but is really practised by hundreds of people in England.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 91, 4, 10, 218703) If, then, vegetarianism be as shown above as good as flesh-eating in other respects, I hope no man, not determined upon setting his face against vegetarianism at any cost, would hesitate to adopt it if it is cheaper than flesh-eating.

New Para:  who do not take even milk and butter, they being animal products.
Before describing the food that can be had for 9s per week,
there are one or two points still remaining to be cleared.
Whether you would cook the food yourself or whether you
would  have it cooked by your landlady, from a religious point of
view, if you are a strict Hindu, you would of course cook your own
food. In this case, your expenses would be much cheaper.
Here let me remark, in spite of all that is said to the contrary,
that given all the resources at your command, there is nothing to
prevent you from leading a purely Hindu life. To say that there are no
cooking arrangements to be had in London is humbug and a mere
bagatelle. It would be true to say that there are very few who have the
mind to do it. Again, to perform the everyday ceremonies, to dine
bare-bodied, to sit in contemplation bare-bodied for hours together
would be impossible for a poor man, but a rich man who is prepared
to spend any amount of money can perform each and every religious
ceremony that can be performed in India. If he does not want to cook
his own food, he can even take a cook with him. But, then, an ordinary
student would not be able to command money and time for such
things. I should like to know how many students are there who find
time or have the mind to perform all the ceremonies even in India. If
they are not performed here, some of them may well be left out in
London without shocking the pious and elderly persons, as even our
scriptures make certain exemptions in favour of travellers and
students. A distinguished yogi told me that he forwent most of the
usual ceremonies while travelling.
For an ordinary Indian who is not overscrupulous in his
religious views and who is not much of a believer in caste restrictions,
it would be advisable to cook partly himself and get a part of his food
ready made.
Of course, he can have all his things cooked by his landlady
which, by a previous arrangement, she engages to do for 7s that are
paid for the rent. But, this would be found to be inconvenient in
certain cases. The landlady may not know the vegetarian cookery. She
may not be honest; she may be very unclean. She may cook
vegetables in utensils used for cooking meat without first cleaning
them. The first two difficulties can be surmounted: she may be given a
cookery book and she would cook the required food by the help of
the book. By a strict watch, she may not be given an opportunity for

New Para:  being dishonest, but if she is not clean, there is no help for the poor
lodger if he has to be at her mercy. The last difficulty can be
overcome or overlooked. So, then, on the whole, it would be better to
cook one's food if the landlady is not clean. Cooking, as perhaps
would be feared, is not at all a difficult or troublesome process. No
smoke, no wood, no cowdung cakes and no blowing or fanning are
associated with the idea of cooking as here advocated. A portable oil
stove serves the purpose of the Indian chulas. On that stove one can
cook almost everything that may be cooked on the Indian chulas for
5 or 6 persons. Moreover, the cooking does not take much time.
Twenty minutes would be found quite sufficient. Ten minutes are
required for boiling milk. During the interval, while milk in boiling,
many find it convenient to read something, e.g., a newspaper. An
enamelled pan, one or two plates, two spoons would be your cooking
utensils. The whole would cost not more than 10s. Water-white
kerosene oil is very good for cooking. It does not give any nasty
smell and burns well. The utensils would be supplied by your
landlady too. It is, however, advisable to buy your own pan.
Some meals may be prepared by the landlady and some taken
outside, e.g., breakfast and supper may be prepared by the landlady
and the midday meal taken outside.
Some meals may be cooked by yourself and others taken
outside. It is not troublesome to prepare one's breakfast and supper
which consist of simple things.
Under every one of these modes it is possible to live on 9s per
week. And every one of the modes has been tried by me as well as
many others.
The first mode is the cheapest, viz., to cook all your meals; but it
would cost more time and may prove inconvenient for a student who
may pass his day in his library.
However, let us see how under the first mode, 9s would give us
sufficient food. As has been said above, the same food that we usually
take in India is sufficient in England.
Then we may see what would be the cost of the Indian meals.
For example, if you stick to the two meals per day, you have for
dinner at 10 p.m. chapati, dal, vegetable, bhat and milk.
Such a dinner would cost as follows:

The above presents a variety sufficient to satisfy the most
delicate tastes and all of these are within the reach of the 9-s man.
Fruits are supposed in England to be absolutely necessary. At
any rate, the vegetarians think so. They are a sure safeguard against
medicine. They purify the blood and keep the bowels regular; since
constipation is the father of many diseases, one cannot do better than
take the utmost precautions to prevent that fell disease. This can be
best done by a liberal use of whole wheat meal and fruits. The fine
wheat flour ordinarily to be had in England is to be discarded
altogether. It is very innutritious and very often injurious when it is
adulterated as it very often is. Moreover, it is insipid. On the other
hand wheat meal flour is very sweet to the taste. So one should always
make it a point to use brown bread made of whole wheat meal flour
and discard the white bread altogether. It may be said that the above
observations are unauthenticated and useless coming from a person
who cannot pretend to any knowledge of chemistry or medicine. Well,
they are not unauthentic. Only the authorities have not been quoted.
That what has been written above is the general opinion of doctors can
be seen by reading the many vegetarian pamphlets published by the
Vegetarian Society. It must be repeated here that the aim of this guide
is not to supersede other useful books and to give all the information,
its aim is to supplement, to give information not hitherto given and to
direct where the proper information can be had.
We assume then that food is to be selected for three meals from
the vegetable kingdom. The meals consist of breakfast at 8*30 a.m.,
dinner at 1 p.m., and supper at 6*30 p.m.
A good breakfast may be made of oatmeal porridge—a
splendid dish especially in winter. In almost every household, they
have this porridge for breakfast in winter. Thousands of Scotch
people live on oatmeal. It tastes like wheat and is sweeter. The
preparation is very simple. You can stir one ounce of oatmeal into a
sufficient quantity of water and put it on the oil stove. If it is fine
oatmeal, the porridge would be ready in 20 minutes. If it is coarse, it
would take 30 minutes. It can be eaten with sugar and milk or stewed
fruit. Stewed fruit is fruit cooked  in water with a little sugar. The
porridge may be made entirely in milk or milk and water. Made in
milk it tastes better. This breakfast would cost as follows :

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 13, 226756) So one should always make it a point to use brown bread made of whole wheat meal flour and discard the white bread altogether.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 14, 226883) It may be said that the above observations are unauthenticated and useless coming from a person who cannot pretend to any knowledge of chemistry or medicine.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 15, 227041) Well, they are not unauthentic.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 16, 227073) Only the authorities have not been quoted.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 17, 227116) That what has been written above is the general opinion of doctors can be seen by reading the many vegetarian pamphlets published by the Vegetarian Society.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 18, 227273) It must be repeated here that the aim of this guide is not to supersede other useful books and to give all the information, its aim is to supplement, to give information not hitherto given and to direct where the proper information can be had.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 19, 227517) We assume then that food is to be selected for three meals from the vegetable kingdom.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 20, 227604) The meals consist of breakfast at 8.30 a.m., dinner at 1 p.m., and supper at 6.30 p.m.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 21, 227691) A good breakfast may be made of oatmeal porridge—a splendid dish especially in winter.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 22, 227778) In almost every household, they have this porridge for breakfast in winter.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 23, 227854) Thousands of Scotch people live on oatmeal.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 24, 227898) It tastes like wheat and is sweeter.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 25, 227935) The preparation is very simple.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 26, 227967) You can stir one ounce of oatmeal into a sufficient quantity of water and put it on the oil stove.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 27, 228066) If it is fine oatmeal, the porridge would be ready in 20 minutes.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 28, 228132) If it is coarse, it would take 30 minutes.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 29, 228175) It can be eaten with sugar and milk or stewed fruit.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 30, 228228) Stewed fruit is fruit cooked in water with a little sugar.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 31, 228287) The porridge may be made entirely in milk or milk and water.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 32, 228348) Made in milk it tastes better.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 95, 1, 33, 228379) This breakfast would cost as follows :

would make a good dinner. Soup made of potatoes, onion and
haricots costs 11/2d. Rice, milk and sugar would cost 2d or less and
bread 1d. This dinner, then, can be had for 41/2 d. And if you are very
fond of butter, you can have a penny worth of butter in which case
your dinner would be 51/2d.

New Para:  The following variety of dinners can be had for and under 5d:
Pea soup and bread and stewed fruit or fresh fruit, rice, milk and
bread and radishes and cheese. Potato soup, bread and semolina with
stewed fruit or milk.
Tapioca pudding bread with almonds and raisins, etc., etc.
Supper may consist of bread, butter and cocoa (3d), bread and
butter and cheese (21/2d), toast and milk and radishes (3d), porridge
and fruit and bread (3d), bread, butter, celery and cheese, etc.
Thus, three meals can be had for 11d or say 1s. These meals are
quite sufficient and nourishing and give as much nutrition as a
sumptuous meat meal with no dyspepsia or other disease which is
generally the consequence of the latter. Thousands subsist well on
such meals.
The three meals or two of them may be cooked by you or by
your landlady. When the cooking is entrusted to the landlady, all the
things must be bought by you so that you may be sure that you get
the right thing at the right price. It may be remarked here that only
those fruits and vegetables must be bought which are in season,
otherwise they are very expensive. Moreover, they must be bought at

hot-house grapes, they would cost 3s per pound. These, of course, you
cannot buy; but you can easily buy the grapes at 4d per pound when
they are in season.
Sometimes, I was going to say very often, it is found convenient
to take the dinner outside. Whether you be a traveller or a student, you
would go out after breakfast and return in the evening. In such a case,
you would not care to return home for dinner. That entails a great loss
of time and trouble and you would not care to go home from your
library, especially if it be some distance from your house. There are
vegetarian restaurants in all the busy quarters of London for such
people. They have generally two divisions. One division provides six-
penny dinners of 3 courses. You buy a ticket and, on presenting the
ticket, you get a selection of 3 out of about 20 courses. The
popularity of these dinners is immense. From 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., very
often it becomes very difficult to find a place owing to the large
number of customers.
In the other division, you can have any number of courses and
you pay for what you eat. A list of items called the menu is shown to
you in which the prices are marked against each item and you select
your dinner according to your appetite and purse. Our 9-s man can
patronize either division. Two courses would be found to be quite
sufficient in the first division. And three courses of the first division
are more than sufficient even for a gourmand. It may be remarked
that there is no difference in the quality of food in both the divisions.
In fact, there are the same dishes in both. In the first division, you
have the satisfaction to know that you pay more and, if you are
ashamed to sit side by side with a labourer, to know that there is no
such person to shame you in the first division. There is again more
room in the first division called the dining-saloon and the hall is better
ornamented. I give a specimen menu showing the courses generally
provided in the vegetarian restaurants of which Dr* Richardson says:

This closes the remarks on the most important subject. There

New Para:  Many we know who, for their own persons put up with plain fare, blush
to set before guests what costs them little. They deem it penurious, shabby,
churlish. This prejudice certainly affects students, at least in England, to no
small extent. Even thrifty men may save three shillings a day, i.e., a guinea a
week, by adopting Spartan self-control. In other words, they may win without
contest a scholarship of £50 a year. tenable for life, purchasing into  the
bargain independence of character and health.
Sir Henry Thomson goes so far as to say that “our eating is
more injurious than our drinking”, and who does not know that we
are more apt to over-eat than under-eat?
To carry out what has been mapped out above, nothing but a
stern will is required. Given that one thing, the way is smooth. A little
experience will accustom you to that mode of life. “Adopt that course
of life which is best and custom will render it delightful.”

of the effects of a very temperate and simple diet in producing health,
cheerfulness and longevity. At the age of 40, his constitution seemed ruined

of food a day and his health became so perfect that for half a century he was

as one of great serenity and enjoyment. He wrote plays, he assisted in
fortifying and embellishing Venice. He enjoyed what he called his beautiful

healthy, merry and happy as if I were but twenty-five.” At this age, and even
on to a hundred years, his senses, memory, heart, judgment and voice were
perfect. He wrote seven or eight hours a day, walked, enjoyed society and
music and sang and played delightfully. His grand-niece writes of him : “He
continued healthy and even vigorous until he was a hundred years old. His
mind did not at all decline. He never required spectacles. He did not become
deaf. His voice remained so strong and harmonious that, at the close of his

daily food as it were. There are now in almost all the parts of London
free public libraries, where are to be found all the leading daily and
weekly papers. These institutions are visited by hundreds of people
every day. So it is always preferable to visit the public libraries to
buying a paper. However,  if necessary,  there is a  sufficient margin
left for spending  6d per week on newspapers. The London
newspapers are very cheap. An evening newspaper can be had for one
half penny.

appointment.
But why are the Barristers at a disadvantage? The fault is partly
their own and partly the people's. Again, there are natural causes.
The fault is their own because they do not come up to the
expectations of the people. Of the people because they expect too
much from them. The natural causes consist in the increase of their
number. When there was only one newspaper, it was prized by all; now
when there are many only few are held in estimation. A first
matriculate was a sort of demi-god. Now when you stumble upon
matriculates, they are sold at a nominal price. Again, when there was
only one Barrister, he was incomparable, now there are many among
whom to set up a comparison.
 So, then, there is no need to be fear-stricken by a little
dislodging of the position; only we must not lower our standard of
work and a time may come when we may be yet too few. That time is
distant though. And, during that time, we ought to be cautious so that
it may not be extended any further.
In being over-hasty we may spoil matters; in not working as we
ought to, we may do the same. We must, therefore, guard against both.
There is nowadays a tendency to do it easily, i.e., to work little
and expect much. This ought to be avoided if we would not be thrown
further downward. If our parents send us to England, or if we hold
ascholarship, we have a sacred trust to perform. We have to account to
our parents or patrons for the work we have done and for the
moneywhich [we] have spent. We ought to do unto them as we would
be done by. If we were to send some one to England at our expense to
become a Barrister, I suppose we would expect him to utilize  every
moment of his stay there and give us an account of how he passed his
time. Exactly the same would be expected of us. Consciousness of this
and work according to it are all that is required of us. If we do that, we
shall have done our duty and will have no occasion to be sorry for
having gone to England. When we go there to be Barristers, we ought
to do there everything that would make of us good Barristers and not
indulge in luxuries or pleasures.
Let those who send their boys to England make sure that they
would discharge their trust faithfully and they will have no occasion to
regret having sent them. The best way to ensure this is to give your
boy just enough money to make of him a Barrister and then tell him

Are there already too many Barristers? Yes and no. Yes, if we
take any one province into account, but, if India as a whole were taken
into account, there are far too few. That Barristers have a field in any
of Her Majesty's dominions seems to have either been forgotten or not
cared for, because every Barrister goes to his native land to practise.
Now, while in one's fatherland there is some chance of success owing
to acquaintances and knowledge of the native country, there is much
disadvantage if the profession is overcrowded. Why not then invade
the regions not yet invaded?
Then, again, a field, I am told, is sure to be opened as well for
Barristers as for all educated persons in the protected States. They are
yet in a very backward state. They are expected to make reforms.
When that time comes, the aid of the educated of the land is likely to
be called in. Again, it is a notorious fact that so far education has been
too much neglected by the agencies and back-door influence has
prevailed. This too will be set right some day.
I must not, however, be misunderstood to advocate the Indians
flocking to England to become Barristers. Whether it is good to be a
Barrister or not is not the province of this guide to discuss. There are
many other guides to throw light on that matter. Indeed, I must
confess freely my incompetence to aid the discussion of that question.
I am simply to guide those who have made up their minds to be
Barristers as to what they would be required to spend, what
examinations they have to pass, how they would gain admission, etc. It
was not without many misgivings and hesitation that I was induced to
insert even the above paragraphs.
Supposing, then, that you have made up your mind to become a
Barrister, the first thing for you to do is to get a certificate of your
having passed the matriculation examination. If you have not passed
the matriculation examination, you will be required to pass an
entrance examination before admission. They examine in History and
Latin, but Indian students are by an application exempted from the
Latin examination. The examination is rather easy.

Those who have joined some university are exempted from the
payment of £100 in the beginning, though they have to pay the sum
in the end. In Lincoln's Inn, those who have passed public
examination only in the British Dominions are exempted from that
payment. I am not sure whether this applies to Indian Universities.
Such information can be had directly by writing to the treasurers of
the respective Inns of which there are four, viz., Inner Temple, Middle
Temple, Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn. Perhaps, from an economic
point of view, Lincoln's Inn is the best Inn, which boasts also the best
library.  Middle Temple is the most patronized by the Indians. From
the education point of view, all the Inns are equal because they have a
common examination. Middle Temple pays the scholarships in cash,
the Inner Temple makes you join chambers and pays for them.
One has to keep twelve terms before being called to the bar.
There are four terms every year, the 1st in January, the 2nd in April,
the 3rd in June and 4th in November. The shortest term lasts 20 days
and the longest about 31 days.
Keeping terms means taking dinners in the respective Inns to
which you belong; you have not necessarily to take your dinner but
you must go to the dining-hall punctually at the appointed time and
sit there for one hour. You are said to have kept one term when you
have attended six dinners in the term. Those who belong to a
university have to attend only three dinners. These dinners, whether
partaken of or not, have to be paid for Inner Temple charges 31/2s per
dinner, Middle Temple 2s. Thus you make a saving of 11/2s every
dinner by joining the Middle Temple. And such dinners have to be
taken 12 times in all. Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn, too, charge most
probably 2s.
If you pay for the dinners and if you have no religious
objection, why should you not take your dinner, one may pertinently
ask? The answer is you ought to dine, but, then, a further question
arises as to what a vegetarian should do. Well, you can have ordinarily
bread and vegetables and cheese, but you can have a better vegetarian
dinner specially prepared for you by applying to the chief steward of
the Inn or, if need be, the sub-treasurer of your Inn. A Parsi friend
who had turned a vegetarian and I used to get our vegetarian dinners
specially prepared.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 2, 244296) This done you get the form of admission for one guinea; you pay the fees which amount to nearly £141. Those who have joined some university are exempted from the payment of £100 in the beginning, though they have to pay the sum in the end.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 3, 244536) In Lincoln's Inn, those who have passed public examination only in the British Dominions are exempted from that payment.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 4, 244657) I am not sure whether this applies to Indian Universities.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 5, 244716) Such information can be had directly by writing to the treasurers of the respective Inns of which there are four, viz., Inner Temple, Middle Temple, Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 6, 244895) Perhaps, from an economic point of view, Lincoln's Inn is the best Inn, which boasts also the best library.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 7, 245003) Middle Temple is the most patronized by the Indians.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 8, 245056) From the education point of view, all the Inns are equal because they have a common examination.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 9, 245153) Middle Temple pays the scholarships in cash, the Inner Temple makes you join chambers and pays for them.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 10, 245258) One has to keep twelve terms before being called to the bar.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 11, 245319) There are four terms every year, the 1st in January, the 2nd in April, the 3rd in June and 4th in November.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 12, 245427) The shortest term lasts 20 days and the longest about 31 days.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 13, 245490) Keeping terms means taking dinners in the respective Inns to which you belong; you have not necessarily to take your dinner but you must go to the dining-hall punctually at the appointed time and sit there for one hour.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 14, 245710) You are said to have kept one term when you have attended six dinners in the term.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 15, 245793) Those who belong to a university have to attend only three dinners.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 16, 245861) These dinners, whether partaken of or not, have to be paid for Inner Temple charges 31/2s per dinner, Middle Temple 2s.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 17, 245981) Thus you make a saving of 11/2s every dinner by joining the Middle Temple.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 18, 246056) And such dinners have to be taken 12 times in all.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 19, 246107) Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn, too, charge most probably 2s.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 20, 246167) If you pay for the dinners and if you have no religious objection, why should you not take your dinner, one may pertinently ask?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 21, 246296) The answer is you ought to dine, but, then, a further question arises as to what a vegetarian should do.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 103, 1, 22, 246401) Well, you can have ordinarily bread and vegetables and cheese, but you can have a better vegetarian dinner specially prepared for you by applying to the chief steward of the Inn or, if need be, the sub-treasurer of your Inn.

in future, every Inn may make it a rule to prepare vegetarian dinners
regularly.
To be fit for being called to the Bar at the end of 12 terms, two
examinations must be passed, one in Roman Law and the other in the
English Laws.
A student can appear in the Roman Law examination after—but
not before—keeping four terms. Thus, after reaching England, the
student has one year at least to prepare for the examination which is
much more than what is required for the purposes of passing the
examination; hence, the brilliant results of the examination. For
Roman Law, Saunder's Justinian is the text-book. Many students,
however, read Hunter's Introduction to Roman Law.
The other examination called the Bar Final a student can appear
in it after—but not before—keeping nine terms, i.e., at the end of two
years after admission. This time, too, is more than enough for the
examination. The examination takes place in the Law of Property,
Common Law including Criminal Law and Equity, and lasts for four
days. It used to last only three days, but now there are two Equity
papers instead of one.
For the Law of Property the prescribed books are:
William's Real Property
      “   Personal Property
Goodeve's Real Property
     “        Personal Property
Edward’s Compendium of the Law of Property in Land.
Students, however, generally find it sufficient to read William's
and Goodeve's Real Property and Goodeve's Personal Property. Very
few read William's on personal property. They read besides, various
guides to the examination. In Law the prescribed Common book is
Broom's Common Law. Indermauer's Common Law is, however, read
in addition to or instead of Broom by the students. For Equity the
prescribed book is Snell's Equity.
The matter of the examination changes almost every year. Thus,
while generally a competent knowledge of the English laws is
required, special subjects are prescribed every year. For instance, for
Equity they  sometimes prescribe certain portions only (e.g., trusts,
mortgages, etc.) from White and Tudor's Leading Cases in Equity.

New Para:  Those, however, who are well grounded in the general principles of
law do not find it difficult to pass.
The latest prospectus
1 of the Council of Legal Education is
appended hereto.
A notion seems to prevail in many quarters that students are
called to the bar without any examinations or that the examinations
are a farce. Both these statements are entirely without foundation and
inventions of fertile brains.
 No doubt the examinations are easy or, rather, found to be
easy. The results are generally good. There are two or three reasons
for the examinations being found easy.
In the first place, they take place four times every year. So, then,
if a student fails, the failure does not shock him so much as it does in
India. In England he can re-appear in three months.
Secondly, the time at the student's disposal for preparation is
ample. While both the examinations are a year's work at the rate of 6
hours per day, to ensure success there are clear two years at the
student's disposal. So, then, the preparation can be made with a light
heart and without having to work hard. Whether it is good that more
than sufficient time should be given for preparation is another
question altogether, but let there be only three months for preparing
for the examinations and we shall have cutting [sic] results and a
different verdict.
Thirdly, there are many facilities for study in the shape of tutors,
etc. It is only in rare cases that tutors should be resorted to. It is a
useless waste of money. And a tutored student never goes beyond
what is required and forgets what he has learnt soon after the
examination. Such is the experience of many. Nothing like self-
preparation.
It is worthy of notice that the tendency nowadays is happily to
raise the standard of the examinations. They have begun to prescribe
more useful matter now. The latest prospectus is a substantial
improvement on the prospectus of two years ago. For merely a
knowledge of Evidence was not [then] necessary; now, however, it is.

want to compete for scholarship examinations. But attending the
lectures has now been made indirectly compulsory as the
examinations are held on the subject of lectures.
Call to the bar is a mere formal ceremony.
After you are called, a certificate is given to you and you have
to apply for a special certificate if you want to practise in India or the
Colonies.
Before leaving England, students, now Barristers, generally get
their names enrolled in Her Majesty's High Court of Justice on a
payment of 5 shillings.
 It may be important here to discuss whether it is desirable that
the student should try for scholarship examinations. It has been said
above that, for the purposes of passing the examinations, the time at
the student's disposal is more than enough. The question, therefore, is
what shall he do with the rest of his time? It may be answered—he will
devote it to private study. Now this is all very well to say. There are
persons who do study as well for the sake of study as for an
examination. But these are exceptions to prove the rule that, unless a
person has a task imposed on him, he will not generally do it only
because it is good. Private study very often gives place to other
pursuits, not so study for an examination. It, therefore, seems better to
impose some examination task upon oneself than to rely upon one's
own will-power to take care of private study.
And, in that case, it is difficult to say whether it is better to
compete for some scholarship or to join some University. In going in
for some scholarships there is one drawback. The competition is
unequal. There may be M.A*’s, B.A*'s and other University men
against mere matriculates who would stand a very poor chance of
winning scholarships. For those who have graduated in India nothing
can be better than trying for the scholarship examinations. Indeed,
there are students who do both—join a University and work for a
scholarship. Matriculates and others, if they try for a scholarship,
while they may not be successful in getting one, will have the
satisfaction of knowing that they have added to the stock of their
knowledge and done some useful work. It may, however, be thought
more advisable for them to graduate in one of the Universities. Then
comes the question of selection of a University. There are Cambridge

University is by far the best. And if a University is to be joined for
enjoyment and pleasures, of course London University would lag far
behind. Oxford and Cambridge would win the palm. There is no, what
is called, University life in London of which there is plenty in Oxford
and Cambridge. London University is an examining body merely and
does not require candidates to have kept any terms. There is no doubt
an opportunity of mixing with Professors in Oxford and Cambridge
which is not to be found in London.
It is said that education in Oxford and Cambridge is very costly.
To graduate and become a Barrister would cost at least Rs* 15,000*
Though I have no personal experience of either, I can say that
education in either should not cost anything more than Barrister's
education except the actual expenses of fees and books. Of course, to
live with such economy one will have to remain a non-collegiate
student. No such charge, however, can be brought against the London
University. And, on that account, it would be better to graduate from
the London University. The great advantage of the London University
is that it holds its examinations even in India. London University
would be found better by vegetarians as there are more facilities for
them in London than anywhere else.
Now, this University is so exacting that even an M.A* or B.A* of
any other University has to matriculate in the London University
before he can appear for any of its degree examinations. But, after
passing the matriculation examination, one can appear in its Law
examinations without having to pass the B.A* examination, as is the
case in the Bombay University. The London LL.B* course nearly
extends to three years after matriculation. So, in three years one can
pass the matriculation and the intermediate LL.B* examination
together with being called to the bar. Such a course of training would
keep the student's hands pretty full and he will find no time to devote
to idle amusements and this would not mean an extra outlay over and
above the cost of a Barrister’s education of more than £20 to 25*
The cost of Barrister’s education:
In order to be called to the bar, it is necessary to leave for
England so as to reach there in time for keeping the November term.

Though I have no personal experience of either, I can say that education in either should not cost anything more than Barrister's education except the actual expenses of fees and books.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 10, 254478) Of course, to live with such economy one will have to remain a non-collegiate student.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 11, 254565) No such charge, however, can be brought against the London University.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 12, 254636) And, on that account, it would be better to graduate from the London University.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 13, 254717) The great advantage of the London University is that it holds its examinations even in India.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 14, 254811) London University would be found better by vegetarians as there are more facilities for them in London than anywhere else.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 15, 254934) Now, this University is so exacting that even an M.A. or B.A. of any other University has to matriculate in the London University before he can appear for any of its degree examinations.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 16, 255121) But, after passing the matriculation examination, one can appear in its Law examinations without having to pass the B.A. examination, as is the case in the Bombay University.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 17, 255296) The London LL.B. course nearly extends to three years after matriculation.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 18, 255371) So, in three years one can pass the matriculation and the intermediate LL.B. examination together with being called to the bar.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 19, 255499) Such a course of training would keep the student's hands pretty full and he will find no time to devote to idle amusements and this would not mean an extra outlay over and above the cost of a Barrister’s education of more than £20 to 25. The cost of Barrister’s education: In order to be called to the bar, it is necessary to leave for England so as to reach there in time for keeping the November term.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 107, 1, 20, 255903) If you start in October or September, you can return in the July of your third year's stay in England.

saving of two months by starting in October, it has been shown in a
pervious chapter that March is the best month to start in for England.
For three years' stay in England we have, in the previous chapter,
calculated the expenses of board and lodging in London, which
amount to £4 per month. So £150 may be allowed for board and
lodging in England during the three years' stay in England. A list of
clothes, too has been given in previous chapter. The clothes contained
[in the list] in that chapter would be quite sufficient at least for the
first year, though by a judicious use no more may be required for two
years. However, a further list of clothes is appended below. These may
be bought as required. But more should in no case be required.
According to one's fancy changes may be made. The sum to be
expended in clothing should not be exceeded.

It must be understood that there is room for economy in the
above list as well as the list given in the previous chapter, economy
both as regards quantity and prices. When the lists were shown to a
friend who is rather exacting than otherwise, he pronounced it to be
extravagant. The evening dress mentioned at the bottom in the list is
meant for the call night. It is compulsory to wear the dress on the call
night, so they say. No one seems to have tried to appear in the
ordinary dress. The experiment is worth trying. However, if one has to
wear the evening dress, he can have it on hire for one evening for 5s at
many shops in the Strand or Fleet Street. It may be borrowed from
friends. It may not be superfluous to mention that expenses of
mending shoes or clothes at times are included in the £1 per week.
Shoes are the article requiring repair rather often. They can be
mended for 1/6 per pair or less. In the list will be found mentioned the
oil stove and pan, etc. They are meant for cooking. They will prove
very useful at times if not always. When travelling, cheap food may
not be procurable, the landlady being not a good cook or from
various other causes. In such cases it will be best to cook one's food.
There remain now to be considered the expenses on account of

New Para:  These were the fees paid by me. Now, if the Middle Temple is
joined and if there are no fees besides those charged in the Inner
Temple, as there are probably not, 72 times 11/2s, i.e., £5-8-0 can be
saved as the Middle Temple dinner costs only 2s [as compared] to the
31/2s of the Inner Temple. I know that in no case do the fees exceed £
152-7-11* Hence £ 153 may be put down as the highest expense for
fees.
Then we come to books. Before enumerating the books, it may
be remarked that the libraries of the several Inns are meant for the use
of their members and it will be their own fault if they do not make a
liberal use of them. Thus, all of the big works on law which have to be
read for the scholarship examination will be found in the library. All
the  works just to be mentioned will also be found in the library.
However, they being books of daily reference may be bought. There
are law lending libraries in London which entitle their members to
issue books to be kept for a month, three months, etc., according to
the subscription they pay. So then he who wants to practise further
economy may make use of these libraries, too.
And, in passing, I may mention that such economy sometimes
becomes very necessary. You may think of travelling and yet may not
afford to spend more than a given sum which did not include
travelling expenses. In that case you must save somewhere. An
instance will be found of a saving thus effected in Appendix A* A few
odd shillings or pence saved now and then and collected swell up the
savings to a decent sum which may be spent in various other useful
pursuits. A mention has nowhere been made of theatres which are a
national institution in England and, as some suppose, a seat of
education and amusement combined. They moreover portray the
modern habits and customs of England. No one would return to India
without visiting the theatres. Then, where is provision for that in the
estimates provided in this guide, it may be asked. They are provided
for generally in the one pound a week and also in the estimates
provided for clothing where a margin has been left for cutting down.
Theatres do not cost much. Gallery seats are one shilling each and pit
2 or 3 1/2d each. The last seats are used by respectable middle-class
persons and frequently patronized by the Indians. Once a month on
an average is more than sufficient and the reader will have remarked
that an ample margin has been left for saving even 4 times 2s. The
arrangements given in the guide will have to be disturbed only when

New Para:  £420 which, as the reader must have seen is capable of being reduced
to £400 quite easily. There are three items, viz., dress in Bombay, that
in London and books, which evidently admit of a reduction of £4 and
the emergency sum ought really to find no place in the estimate as
that has been taken into account in the £150 for board and lodging.
Attention ought to be drawn to the first two items which have
been estimated in rupees and then reduced to pounds sterling at the
present rate of exchange which is nearly Rs* 16 for one pound. In
rupees, as will have been noticed, it amounts to nearly Rs* 653;
represented in pounds, it would fluctuate with the exchange.
The passage Rs* 370, too, is subject to variation. Already owing
to the sinking down of the rupee, the passage has been raised some 20
p.c. If the rate goes higher, as it is expected to, [it] is likely that the
fare would be brought down to its original value.
Now it has to be discussed how many pounds you will take with
you. Of course, Rs* 653 or thereabouts will be spent in Bombay. On
reaching London you will have to pay your fees amounting to nearly
£141* Out of this £41 are taken as fee and £100 as deposit as security
for further dues to your Inn. It has been said above that this deposit is
excused in certain cases. If you are sure that you come under the
excuse rules, you may take £100 less. But, in all other cases, take with
you or be sure that you will get on your landing in England at least
175 pounds sterling. If you take money with you, of course, you
would not take it in cash, but take a bill of exchange to some bank.
Messrs Hutchinson & Co., are good bankers and cater for Indian
customers. Mr* Wm. Digby is concerned with the business. They
undertake to supply gratis the requisite information to Indians about
lodging, etc. I do not suppose they would be able, however, to show
them cheap lodgings. They have got  a list of families who take
Indians, as boarders, but these families charge nearly 30s per week for
board and lodging. Some charge even 25s. But they may be told that
you want to live cheaply and perhaps they would secure you good
lodgings. On this point, however, the editor of The Vegetarian would
be the best guide. He has promised to find suitable lodging for
Indians asking for his advice. That is by the way. As bankers, Messrs
Hutchinson & Co. would be quite good. Their address in London is :

them. All these firms get their customer's letters free of charge. It is
better, however, to get your letters at your Inn or at your lodging
when you have fixed upon one.
It would be advisable to keep two or three pounds with you in
cash in order to pay for your railway-ticket on landing in London and
to pay a few shillings to the steward of your cabin or to pay for boat
hires if you land at various stations touched by your boat.
Although the estimates supplied are not the lowest possible it is
supposed that no one would venture to go to England who could not
afford £420, i.e., at the present rate of exchange Rs* 6,720* I have,
however, a word to say further. If you have got Rs* 10,000, do not
spend all in London, thinking that you would be able to lead a
happier life there.
I shall just diverge from my main subject. I am going
immediately to point out that, from every point of view, the life you
would have to lead on £420 would be happier than the life led by
many a student in India. And mind, Rs* 10,000 would not supply you
with luxuries. They would simply make you pine for more to vie with
your luxurious brothers and thus, in fact, make you more miserable.
Did you say one room in England would not be sufficient for you? I
ask you, then, what have you been having here? Do you not sleep,
even though you may be the son of a rich man, two or three in one
room, a room without a carpet, without any furniture, surrounded by
dirty ditches having hardly a window or two? Have you not in
Bombay used the same room for kitchen, bed-room and sitting room?
Why, I have seen very rich students spending money like water living
in a dirty house not even swept daily. Did you say you could not live
on the food provided in the book? Well, if so, you can only be pitied.
I am sure that you are having no better food here. Do you always
taste, much less eat

only, in India, with milk only once in the day? Did you say you could
not cook your food? Well, if so, it is not absolutely necessary that you
should cook in London except for your religion. But, does not many

pound per week? A nice comfortable room all to yourself, a room
with a nice carpet specklessly clean, a nice bedstead with a feather bed,
two pillows, looking-glass, washing-stand, chairs, etc. (see the
description ante). The maid of the house always makes the bedding
for you, washes your basin and dances attendance on you whenever
you want her and does all the household work for you. You have not
to cry out aloud for her, but just touch the bell and she knocks at your
door and enters only when you say, yes. That surely is not a miserable
life and, if it be miserable, the Rs* 10,000 would not make it less so.
To return, then, to our subject from the digression: if you have
Rs* 10,000, keep them. Only spend out of them Rs* 6,000 or the
equivalent of £420* And the rest you will be able to command on
your return to India. What a relief! Just ask a junior how he felt to be
told that he would be able to command some Rs* 2,000 to go on with
in India and you will gauge the measure of relief. But, if you spend
the whole Rs* 10,000, why to find yourself without money on your
return would cause far greater pain than the additional happiness,
which you may expect but are sure not to get by spending more than
£420 worth of rupees. It is absolutely necessary that you should have
some money, [Rs*] 1,000, 2,000 or any such sum at your disposal.
Then you would not regret having gone to England. On that you
would be able to build your position, but, if you have not got the
foundation money, any edifice you may hope to build without that
foundation would crumble down to pieces and you would find
yourself in the open air without an edifice. For there is no work
awaiting you on your return. There may be empty honours and
congratulations just to sting you. Even if there be work, perhaps,
without a knowledge of practice you will not be able to accept it.
Therefore, if you would take the advice of one who has undergone the
bitter experience and would profit by it, if you have Rs* 10,000, only
spend £420 worth and keep the rest to be spent in India and you
would be happy and contented. No one would point his finger at you;
your position you would not feel unstable. And, in two years or so,
according to abilities and opportunities, you would be able to establish
yourself as a respectable Barrister. Nay, more, the economical habits
cultivated in England would stand you in good stead in India. You
would then be able to “pull on” better and not feel the want of the
luxurious way of living. Indeed, if you do not expect to command
about Rs* 2,000 on your return, it were advisable not to go to England

Too much stress cannot be laid, if you want to practise in India
on your return, on the importance of studying the Indian Codes in
England. These books will be available in your library. Whitley
Stoke's Anglo-Indian Codes are very popular with Indian students in
England.
There are books published for the information and guidance of
those wishing to go to England for study. They invariably give much
higher estimates than those given here. It will occupy a very large
space to answer them here. I can only say that they may be read side
by side with this and compared. There is, however, an association
doing good work for Indians that deserves notice. It is the national
Indian Association. So long as it can count upon the active services of
that good and philanthropic lady, Miss E* A* Manning, 35 Bloomfield
Road, Maiden Hill, the Association cannot fail to do good. She may,
indeed, be consulted by every Indian whom she is always willing to
help and give kind advice to. But the information given by the
Association is, I am afraid, not trustworthy. The estimates furnished by
it are too extravagant. I have talked to some of those who were put
under the care of the Association, and they told me that the estimates
given were extravagant. They are as follows in the India Magazine
and Review,  the organ of the Association:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 115, 1, 8, 271808) They invariably give much higher estimates than those given here.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 115, 1, 9, 271874) It will occupy a very large space to answer them here.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 115, 1, 11, 272003) There is, however, an association doing good work for Indians that deserves notice.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 115, 1, 12, 272087) It is the national Indian Association.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 115, 1, 13, 272126) So long as it can count upon the active services of that good and philanthropic lady, Miss E. A. Manning, 35 Bloomfield Road, Maiden Hill, the Association cannot fail to do good.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 115, 1, 14, 272305) She may, indeed, be consulted by every Indian whom she is always willing to help and give kind advice to.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 115, 1, 15, 272411) But the information given by the Association is, I am afraid, not trustworthy.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 115, 1, 16, 272490) The estimates furnished by it are too extravagant.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 115, 1, 17, 272541) I have talked to some of those who were put under the care of the Association, and they told me that the estimates given were extravagant.

sum of £30 is also required to meet the expenses of outfit on arrival.
 So, according to the above, the expenses amount to £250 per

Final examination and superintendence so that he may not go astray.
Will it not be better to keep your boy with you if he required a strict
watch than trust him to the superintendence of a committee not one of
whom you know personally? It must be by this time clear to those
who know or must know that no amount of superintendence,
especially of the above type, would set a student right if he is bent
upon going astray. He must be trusted to take care of himself or not
sent at all. Only, he must not be given a full command of the purse so
that he may play fast and loose with it. It is the purse more than
anything else that is the most powerful instrument in spoiling a
student in England. Why, it would be quite safe to undertake to spoil
two students on £250 a year. It is not, however, for a moment argued
that a single penny more than £50 a year spent would be credited to
extravagance. Far from it. Even £500 a year can be spent usefully in
England. The aim of this guide is not, however, to show how £500 can
be spent usefully per year in England, but to show that one can live
happily on £50 per year and do all the things generally done by
Indian students in England spending much more.

I, therefore, began with the sweets. I lived upon them exclusively
for about two or three days and could have done so for a long time,
but one of the Indian friends mentioned above was very fond of his
roti and rice and dal; so he arranged with one of the native sailors to
cook us some Indian dishes. The flour and other articles were
provided free of charge by the steamer authorities. So we lived on
these Indian dishes. The sailors were very dirty and I generally
preferred the English loaf to the roti. In spite of the persuasions of the
brother passengers, I could not persuade myself to sit at the table with
them to eat. I was so modest. During the return voyage, however, I
naturally managed better. I was not ashamed to sit at the same table
with other passengers. And it is very desirable that, if one has no
religious objections, to do so even on going to England. There is
sufficient vegetable food provided on the steamer. I, however,
requested the chief steward to supply some vegetable foods and I had
usually for breakfast oatmeal porridge, milk and stewed fruit and
bread, butter and jam and marmalade and cocoa. For dinner I had
rice, vegetable curry, milk and jam pastry, stewed fruit, bread and
butter. For supper bread, butter, jam, cocoa, some lettuce with pepper
and salt and cheese. I had only three meals per day. Two days in the
week they provide fresh fruit and nuts on the steamer.
How I began on 12 pounds per month:
After staying with a friend for a month who treated me very
kindly and taught me how to behave and how to use the fork and the
spoon.
1 I moved to a family where I had to pay 30s per week for
board and lodging. Thus, my board and lodging cost me only £6* I
was told, however, that living on £12 per month would be considered
very economical. I therefore managed somehow or other to spend £12
 per month. I did not discard tea from the very beginning. Did I
believe at first in taking only three meals per day? A suggestion was
thrown out by somebody that I would be considered to be stingy if I
took all meals every day in the family and tea very often. Following
up this suggestion, I used to lunch outside at least once a week and
take tea only thrice a week. Thus, I paid for all this in the family; I
spent about 10s in the lunching and taking tea outside. I used to
spend unnecessarily a great deal also in travelling. It need hardly be

you are not stingy or that you are rolling in wealth is   anything  but
gentlemanly  and entirely unnecessary.  Of course,  it is another thing
altogether when you have to dine or take tea outside because you have
to go far for some business and it would be a waste of time to return
home for tea. Again, while living in the family, you are supposed to
be punctual. They have fixed times for all the meals and they do not
or are not expected to wait for you. So, if you are outside and if you
think that you would not reach in time for your meal, that would be a
case of dining outside. These occasions are rare and do not at all
prove costly, though one who would live on £4 per month cannot
afford to do these things. He cannot even get into a good family for
£1 per week.
The food they used to provide for dinner was third-rate; (no
fault of the family. I was the first vegetarian boarder with them) :
vegetable soups and a vegetable, mostly potatoes, and some fresh fruit.
For breakfast they gave me bread and butter and jam and tea and I
had porridge occasionally. For lunch they gave me bread and butter
and cheese invariably. For tea, bread and butter and tea and cake
sometimes. All  this did not cost them more than 7s per week. Thus, it
will be seen that I paid 30s not because the cost of giving board and
lodging was so much or even half so much, but because of the
privilege of being allowed to enjoy their company.
It is generally thought desirable to live in families in order to
learn the English manners and customs. This may be good for a few
months, but to pass three years in a family is not only unnecessary but
often tiresome. And it would be impossible to lead a regular student's
life in the family. This is the experience of many Indians. If you live

me to cook her room would not be spoiled as I simply wanted to
prepare porridge or boil the milk and I told her also that, if her carpet
was spoiled, I would pay for the spoiling. She after some hesitation
accepted my proposal and I took her room for 8s per week. After
leaving my luggage in the room, I went out in search of the vegetarian
restaurant. I could not find it. And I thought my experiment would
fail. This gloomy outlook was rendered gloomier still when I found
that no restaurant-keeper would arrange to provide me a dinner
consisting of vegetable soup, and bread and butter for one shilling.
All  thought they could not undergo the bother for one man. I
thought the task was hopeless and that I would be obliged to pay 2s or
3s merely for a dinner. I was quite tired by this time and very hungry,
but I did not give up. I knew that I was to take rest and was not to read
much during my stay in Brighton. So I said to myself that if I should
cook two meals, why not cook three? As soon as the idea flashed in
my mind, I caught hold of it, went to a grocer and bought the
necessary things and went to my place.
 On reaching the house, I told the landlady that, although the
arrangement was to allow me to cook only two meals, I would have to
cook three. She was angry and would have driven me out of the
house, had I not offered to raise the rent from 8 to 10s. I then set
about to work. The first evening I prepared porridge and stewed fruit
and I liked it very much. The next morning I had the same.
For dinner I had haricot soup which proved to be very
nourishing and nice. I thus arranged my meals for the [four] weeks.
For breakfast I had bread and milk and stewed fruit and bread and
butter (3d), for dinner I had soup (11/2), strawberries (2d) and bread
(1d). For supper I had porridge (11/2), bread and butter and fruit (2).
Thus I spent only 11d or 1 shilling per day at the most for food in
Brighton. With the 10s rent, 3 shillings for washing, the whole
expenses for board and lodging for four weeks amounted to £3-10-0*
And it cost me £4-8-5 for fares to and from Brighton. Thus I was able
for four pounds to go to live for four weeks in and return from
Brighton.
I found out during the last week of my stay in Brighton that

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 119, 1, 2, 281057) them said: “No, I cannot give the room even for 20s.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 119, 1, 3, 281110) The whole carpet would be spoiled by stain of grease and no one else after you leave would take my room.” I however assured her that she so spoke because her ideas were associated with mutton and that by allowing me to cook her room would not be spoiled as I simply wanted to prepare porridge or boil the milk and I told her also that, if her carpet was spoiled, I would pay for the spoiling.

New Para:  there was a vegetarian home where I could have got board and
lodging for 14s per week. The house is situated near the Preston Park.
The weekly rent was 5s, breakfast 4d, dinner 9d, and supper 4d. Had I
found the house a little earlier, I could have lived in Brighton yet
more cheaply and more comfortably; but I would not have learnt how
to cook with facility. There is also another vegetarian house in
Brighton where they charge 18s per week for board and lodging.
It may be said  that the cooking did not take much time. The
breakfast took only 10 minutes to be ready. For there was only milk
to be made hot. The supper took nearly 20 minutes and the dinner 1
hour. Thus encouraged by success on reaching London, the first thing
for me to do was to go on in search of a suitable bed-sitting room. I
selected a room in Tavistock Street for 8s a week. Here I cooked my
breakfast and supper and dined outside. The landlady supplied me
with plates, spoons and knife, etc. The breakfast almost always
consisted of porridge, stewed fruit and bread and butter (3d). I dined
for 6d at one of the many vegetarian restaurants and for supper I had
bread and milk and some stewed fruit or radishes or fresh fruit (3d);
so then the expenses for board and lodging in England were, during
the last 9 months of my stay, only 15s and even 14s latterly when, in
the same house, I took up a 7-s room. During this time I enjoyed the
best of health and had to work very hard, if not the hardest, as there
were only 5 months left for the final examination.
I used to walk about 8 miles every day and in all I had three
walks daily, one in the evening at 5*30 p.m. for an hour and the other
always for 30 or 45 minutes before going to bed. I never suffered
from ill health except once when I suffered from bronchitis owing to
over-work and neglect of exercise. I got rid of it without having to
take any medicine. The good health I enjoyed is attributable only to
vegetable diet and exercise in the open air. Even the coldest weather
or the densest fog did not prevent me from having my usual walks.
And under the advice of Dr* Allinson, the champion of open air, I
used to keep my bedroom windows open about 4 inches in all
weathers. This is not generally done by people in winter, but it seems
to be very desirable. At any rate it agreed with me very well.

New Para:  34*  AN EXPERIMENT IN VITAL FOOD

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 135, 4, 8, 310707) 34. AN EXPERIMENT IN VITAL FOOD
New Para:  Before describing the experiment, if it may be called one, I
would mention that I gave the vital food a trial in Bombay for a week;
that I left it off only because at the time I had to entertain many
friends, and because there were some other social considerations; that
the vital food agreed with me very well than; and that, had I been able
to continue it, very likely it would have suited me.
I give the notes as I took them while I was conducting the
experiment.
August 22nd, 1893* Began the vital food experiment. I have
been having a cold for the last two days, with a slight cold in the ears
too. Had two tablespoonfuls of wheat, one of peas, one of rice, two of
sultanas, about twenty small nuts, two oranges, and a cup of cocoa for
breakfast. The pulses and cereals were soaked overnight. I finished the
meal in 45 minutes. Was very bright in the morning, depression came
on in the evening, with a slight headache. For dinner had the usual
things —bread, vegetables, etc.
 August 23rd. Feeling hungry, had some peas last evening.
Owing to that I did not sleep well, and woke up with a bad taste in the
mouth in the morning. Had the same breakfast and dinner as
yesterday. Though the day was very dull and it rained a little, I had no
headache or cold. Had tea with Baker
1* This did not agree at all. Felt
pains in the stomach.
August 24th. In the morning woke up uneasy, with a heavy
stomach. Had the same breakfast, except that the one spoonful of peas
was reduced to half. The usual dinner. Did not feel well. Had feeling
of indigestion the whole day.
August 25th. Felt a heaviness in the stomach when I got up.

New Para:  During the day, too, did not feel well. Had no appetite for dinner. Still
I had it. There were undercooked peas for dinner yesterday. That may
have to do with the heaviness. Got headache in the latter part of the
day. Took some quinine after dinner. The same breakfast as
yesterday.
August 26th. Rose up with a heavy stomach. For breakfast I had
half a tablespoonful of peas, half of rice, half of wheat, two and a half
of sultanas, ten walnuts, and one orange. The mouth did not taste well
throughout the day. Did not feel well either. Had the usual dinner. At
7 p.m. had an orange and a cup of cocoa. I feel hungry (8 p.m.), and
yet no desire to eat. The vital food does not seem to agree well.
August 27th. In the morning got up very hungry, but did not
feel well. For breakfast had one-and-a-half tablespoonfuls of wheat,
two of raisins, ten walnuts and an orange (mark, no peas and rice).
Towards the latter part of the day felt better. The cause of yesterday's
heaviness was perhaps peas and rice. At 1 p.m. had one teaspoonful of
unsoaked wheat, one tablespoonful of raisins, and fourteen nuts (thus,
the usual dinner was replaced by vital food). At Miss Harris's had tea
(bread, butter, jam and cocoa). I enjoyed the tea very much and felt as
if I was having bread and butter after a long fast. After tea felt very
hungry and weak. Had, therefore, a cup of cocoa and an orange on
returning home.
August 28th. In the morning the mouth did not taste well. Had
one and a half tablespoonfuls of wheat, two of raisins, twenty nuts, one
orange and a cup of cocoa; except that I felt weak and hungry I felt
all right. The mouth, too, was all right.
August 29th. Woke up well in the morning. For breakfast had
one-and-half tablespoonfuls of wheat, two of sultanas, one orange and
twenty nuts. For dinner had three tablespoonfuls of wheat, two of
currants and twenty nuts and two oranges. In the evening had rice,
vermicelli and potatoes at Tyab's. Felt weak towards evening.
August 30th. For breakfast had two tablespoonfuls of wheat, two
of raisins, twenty walnuts, and one orange. For dinner had the same
things with an addition of one more orange. Felt very weak. Could not
take the usual walks without fatigue.
August 31st. When I got up in the morning the mouth was very
sweet. Felt very weak. Had the same quantity of food both for
breakfast and dinner. Had a cup of cocoa and an orange in the
evening. Felt extremely weak throughout the day. I can take the walks

sweet.
September 1st. Got up in the morning quite tired. Had the same
breakfast as yesterday, the same dinner. Feel very weak; teeth are
aching. The experiment must be left off. Had tea with Baker as it was
his birthday. Felt better after the tea.
September 2nd. Woke up fresh in the morning (the effect of last
evening's tea). Had the old food (porridge, bread, butter, jam and
cocoa). Felt ever so much better.
Thus ended the vital food experiment.
Under more favourable circumstances it might not have failed.
A boarding-house, where one cannot control everything, where it is
not possible to make frequent changes in the diet, is hardly a place
where food experiments can be conducted successfully. Again, it will
have been noticed that the only fresh fruit that I could get was
oranges. No other fruits were to be had in the Transvaal then.
It is a matter of great regret that, although the Transvaal soil is
very fruitful, the fruit cultivation is very much neglected. Again, I
could not get any milk, which is a very dear commodity here. People
generally use condensed milk in South Africa. It must, therefore, be
admitted that the experiment is entirely useless to prove the value of
vital food. It were sheer audacity to venture any opinion on the vital
food after an eleven days' trial under adverse circumstances. To
expect the stomach, used for twenty years and upwards to cooked
food, to assimilate, at a stroke, uncooked food, is too much, and yet I
think the experiment has its value. It should serve as a guide to others,
who would embark upon such experiments, attracted to them by some
of their charms, but have not the ability, or the means, or the
circumstances, or the patience, or the knowledge to carry them to a
successful issue. I confess I had none of the above qualifications.
Having no patience to watch the results slowly, I violently changed my
diet. From the very start, the breakfast consisted of the vital food,
while four or five days had hardly passed when the dinner, too,
consisted of vital food. My acquaintance with the vital food theory
was very superficial indeed. A little pamphlet by Mr* Hills, and one or
two articles that recently appeared from his pen in The Vegetarian
were all I knew about it. Anyone, therefore, not possessing the
necessary qualifications, is, I believe, doomed to failure, and will hurt

And after all, is it worth while for an ordinary vegetarian to
devote his attention to such pursuits—a vegetarian who enjoys good
health and is satisfied with his diet? Would it not be better to leave it to
the adepts who devote their lives to such researches? These remarks
apply especially to those vegetarians who base their creed on the
grand basis of humanitarianism—who are vegetarians because they
consider it wrong, nay, even sinful, to kill animals for their food. That
the ordinary vegetarianism is possible, is conducive to health, he who
runs may see. What more, then, do we want? Vital food may have its
grand possibilities in store; but it will surely not make our perishable
bodies immortal. That any considerable majority of human beings
would ever do away with cooking does not seem feasible. The vital
food will not, cannot, as such, minister to the wants of the soul. And if
the highest aim, indeed, the only aim of this life, be to know the soul,
then, it is humbly submitted, anything that takes away from our
opportunities of knowing the soul, and therefore, also playing with the
vital food and other such experiments, is playing away, to that extent,
the only desirable aim in life.
If we are to eat that we may live to the glory of Him, of whom
we are, then, is it not sufficient that we eat nothing that, to Nature, is
repulsive, that requires the unnecessary spilling of blood? No more,
however, of this while I am yet on the threshold of my studies in that
direction. I simply throw out these thoughts, which were passing
through the mind while I was conducting the experiment, so that some
dear brother or sister may find, perchance, an echo of their own in
this.
The reasons which led me to try the vital food were its extreme
simplicity. That I could dispense with cooking, that I could carry
about my own food wherever I went, that I should not have to put up
with any uncleanness of the landlady or those who supplied me with
food, that, in travelling in such countries as South Africa, the vital
food would be an ideal food, were charms too irresistible for me. But
what a sacrifice of time and trouble to achieve what is after all a selfish
end, which falls short of the highest! Life seems too short for these
things.

New Para:  MY DEAR BROTHER,
If you are a vegetarian, I think it is your duty to join the
London Vegetarian Society, and to subscribe to The Vegetarian if you
have not done so already.
It is your duty because —
(1) You will thereby encourage and aid the creed you profess.
(2) That will be an expression of the bond of sympathy that
should exist between a vegetarian and a vegetarian in a land where
there are so few of them.
  (3) The vegetarian movement will indirectly aid India
politically also, inasmuch as the English vegetarians will more readily
sympathize with the Indian aspirations (that is my personal
experience).
(4) Looking at the question even from a purely selfish point of
view, you will thereby be able to have a large circle of vegetarian
friends who ought to be more acceptable than others.
(5) Your knowledge of the vegetarian literature will enable you
to remain firm in your principles in a land where you are exposed to
so many temptations, which have in very many cases proved
irresistible, and you will, in case of illness, be able to get the aid of
vegetarian doctors and drugs, whom and which you will know very
easily, having joined the Society and subscribed to its paper.
(6) That will help your fellow-brothers in India a great deal, and
be also a means of dispelling the doubt that still lingers in the minds
of our parents as to the possibility of existence under a vegetarian diet,

India.
Many more reasons can be given to show why you should join

sufficient to induce you to view my proposal with favour.
Even if you are not a vegetarian, you will find that many of the
above reasons will apply to you also, and you can subscribe to The

existence on the blood of their fellow-creatures.
Of course, there is also the Manchester Vegetarian Society and
its organ The Vegetarian Messenger. I have pleaded for the L.V.S*

and because its organ is weekly.

submit, a proof of their capabilities as regards representation.
13* Indeed, so much has the Indians' ability to understand
representative institutions been recognized by Her 
Majesty's
Government that India enjoys municipal local self-government in the
truest sense of the term.
14* There were, in 1891, 755 municipalities and 892 local
boards in India, with 20,000 Indian members. This would give some
idea of the magnitude of the municipalities and the electorate.
15* If further proof be needed on this head, your Petitioners
draw the Honourable Members' attention to the recently passed India
Councils Bill, whereby the system of representation has been

Presidencies of India.
16* Your Honourable Assembly will, your Petitioners trust, see,
therefore, that the exercise of the franchise by them is no extension of
a new privilege they have never before known or enjoyed, but on the
contrary, the disqualification to exercise it would be an unjust restric
tion which, under similar circumstances, would never be put on them
in the land of their birth.
17* Hence, also, your Petitioners submit that the fear that they
may, if they were allowed to exercise the privilege of franchise,
“become propagandists of agitation and instruments of sedition in
that great country they come from”, is, to say the least of it, without
ground.

minor points and the needlessly harsh remarks made in the course of

Your Petitioners would rather have been judged by their works than
have sought to justify themselves by quoting what others have thought
of their race; but, under the present circumstances, they have no other
course left open to them, since, owing to want of free intercourse,
there seems to prevail much misunderstanding about their capabilities.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 145, 1, 4, 331363) 13. Indeed, so much has the Indians' ability to understand representative institutions been recognized by Her Majesty's Government that India enjoys municipal local self-government in the truest sense of the term.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 145, 1, 5, 331577) 14. There were, in 1891, 755 municipalities and 892 local boards in India, with 20,000 Indian members.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 145, 1, 6, 331680) This would give some idea of the magnitude of the municipalities and the electorate.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 145, 1, 7, 331765) 15.

We have to thank Your Honour very much for sparing some of
Your Honour's valuable time to receive this deputation.
We beg to present this petition of the Indians residing in the
Colony to Your Honour and beg you to give it Your Honour's earnest
attention.
We would not trespass longer on Your Honour’s courtesy than
is absolutely necessary. We, however, regret that we have not at our
disposal time enough to lay our case as thoroughly as possible before
Your Honour.
Sir, we have been taunted with having woken up almost too late.
It is only necessary to put before you the peculiar circumstances to
convince Your Honour that we could not possibly have approached
the honourable Houses earlier. The two chief leading members of the
community were away from the Colony on urgent business and were
shut out from all communication with people in the Colony. Our very
imperfect knowledge of the English language materially prevents us
from keeping ourselves in touch with important matters as we should
like to be.

New Para:  With greatest respect to Your Honour, we beg to point out that
both the Anglo-Saxon and the Indian races belong to the same stock.
We read Your Honour's eloquent speech at the time of the second
reading of the Bill with rapt attention and took great pains to ascertain
if any writer of authority gave countenance to the view expressed by
Your Honour about the difference of the stocks from which both the
races have sprung up. Max Muller, Morris, Greene and a host of other
writers with one voice seem to show very clearly that both the races
have sprung from the same Aryan stock, or rather the Indo-European
as many call it. We have no wish whatever to thrust ourselves as
members of a brother nation on a nation that would be unwilling to
receive us as such, but we may be pardoned if we state the real facts,
the alleged absence of which has been put forward as an argument to
pronounce us as unfit for the exercise of the franchise.
Your Honour has, moreover, been reported to have said that it
would be cruel to expect Indians to exercise the privilege of franchise.
We humbly submit that our petition is a sufficient answer to this.
It has given us no small satisfaction to know that, however unjust
Your Honour's speech may have appeared to us from our point of
view, it breathed truest sentiments of justice, morality and, what is
more, Christianity. So long as such a spirit is noticeable among the
chosen of the land, we would never despair of right being done in
every case.
It is therefore that we have ventured to approach Your Honour,
fully believing that, in the light of the new facts disclosed by our
humble petition, a display of the same sentiments will result in
substantial justice being done to the Indians in the Colony.
We believe that the prayer of the petitioners is very modest. If
the newspaper reports are trustworthy, Your Honour was pleased to
acknowledge that there were some respectable Indians who were
intelligent enough to exercise the precious privilege. That alone, in
our humble opinion, is a sufficient reason for granting a Commission
of enquiry into the momentous question. We are willing to face, nay,
we court such a Commission, and, will it be asking too much if we ask
that the Indians should be allowed to exercise the privilege, if the
impartial judgment of an impartial Commission pronounced the
Indians fit for such an exercise? If we have understood the Bill rightly,
the Indians would, in the event of its becoming law, rank lower than
the lowest native. For, while the latter can educate himself into fitness

Do you conscientiously say that the
Franchise  Law  Amendment  Bill is
a  strictly just measure without need-
ing any modification or change?
2*
Do you think it just that those India-
ns, who have not been able, from some
cause or other, to have their names on
       the Voters' List, should ever be debarr-
       ed from voting in the Parliamentary
       Elections, no matter how capable they
       may be or what interests they may have
       in the Colony?
3*    Do you really believe that no Indian Briti-
       sh subject can ever acquire sufficient attai-
        nments for the purpose of becoming a full
       citizen of the Colony or of voting?
4*    Do you think it just that a man should not
       become a voter simply because he is of Asiatic
       extraction?
5*    Do you wish the indentured Indian who comes
       and settles in the Colony to remain in the state
       of semi-slavery and ignorance for ever, unless
        he chooses to go back to India for ever?

New Para:  MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,
At a meeting held on the 1st July, 1894, of leading Indians in
Durban,  we were requested to await Your Excellency’s pleasure with
regard to the Franchise Law Amendment Bill, which was read a third
time last evening in the Honourable the Legislative Assembly of the
Colony of Natal.
The Bill as it stands, disqualifies every Indian, whether a British
subject or not, not already on the Voters' List, from becoming a voter.
We venture to say that, without any further qualification, the Bill
is manifestly unjust, and would work very harshly at any rate upon
some Indians.
Even in England, any British subject having the proper
qualifications is entitled to vote, irrespective of caste, colour, or creed.
We would not deal at length with the question here lest we
should trespass too much upon Your Excellency's courtesy, but would
beg leave to present Your Excellency with a printed copy of the
petition addressed to the Honourable Assembly and request Your
Excellency to persue it carefully.
To us our cause seems to be so just that it should not need any
arguments to support it.
We trust that Your Excellency, representing Her Most Gracious
Majesty the Queen Empress, will not sanction a measure that would
seem to lay down that an Indian British subject of Her Majesty can
never become fit to exercise the franchise.

Petitioners, therefore, have ventured to approach your Hon. Council
with a view to inducing the Hon. Members to give close attention to
the petition hereinbefore referred to, and to use your correctional
power in consonance with justice and equity. Some of your Petitioners
undersigned had the honour to see some of the Hon. Members of the
Lower House in connection with the petition aforesaid, and they all
seemed to admit the justice of the prayer contained in the said
petition, but the general feeling seemed to be that it was addressed too
late. Your Petitioners, without going into the question, would
respectfully submit that, assuming that it was so, the consequences of
the Bill becoming law would be so grave, and the prayer is so just and
modest, that being too late should not have weighed with the Hon.
Members at all in considering the petition. Instances of Bills being
thrown out or modified, under less imperative circumstances, by the
Parliaments of civilized countries, after they have passed through the
committee stage,  would not be difficult to find. Your Petitioners need
hardly mention the instance of the House of Lords having thrown out
the Irish Home Rule Bill

treated. The Franchise Law Amendment Bill as it stands is, your
Petitioners submit, so sweeping a measure, that no Indian who is not
already on the Voters' List, no matter how capable he may be, can be
come a voter if the Bill becomes law. Your Petitioners trust that your
Hon. Council will not endorse such a view, and will, therefore, send the
Bill back again to the Legislative Assembly for its reconsideration.
And for this act of justice and mercy, your Petitioners, as in duty
bound, will ever pray.

New Para:  DURBAN,
July 5, 1894
The first Parliament of Natal under Responsible Government has
been pre-eminently an Indian Parliament. It has for the most part
occupied itself with legislation affecting Indians, by no means
favourably. The Governor, in opening the Legislative Council and
Assembly, remarked that his Ministers would deal with the Franchise
which was exercised by Indians in Natal, although they never
exercised it in India. The reasons given for the sweeping measure to
disfranchise Indians were that they had never exercised the Franchise
before, and that they were not fit for it.
The petition of the Indians seemed to prove a sufficient answer
to this. Hence they have now turned round and given out the real
object of the Bill, which is simply this: “We do not want the Indians
any more here. We want the coolies, but they shall remain slaves here
and go back to India as soon as they are free.” I earnestly request
your undivided attention to the cause and appeal to you to use your
influence that always has been and is being used on behalf of the
Indians, no matter where situated. The Indians look up to you as
children to the father. Such is really the feeling here.
A word for myself and what I have done. I am yet
inexperienced and young and, therefore, quite liable to make
mistakes. The responsibility undertaken is quite out of proportion to
my ability. I may mention that I am doing this without any
remuneration. So you will see that I have not taken the matter up,
which is beyond my  ability, in order to enrich myself at the expense
of the Indians. I am the only available person who can handle the
question. You will, therefore, oblige me very greatly if you will kindly
direct and guide me and make necessary suggestions which shall be
received as from a father to his child.

(b) While some Indian fathers will be able to vote, their children
never can, although the latter may surpass the former in every respect.
 (c) It practically puts the free and indentured Indians in the
same scale.
(d) Taking out for a moment the question of policy as the
principle of the Bill, which seems to have developed but lately, the Bill
seems to lay down that India has not at the present moment any
Indian who is fit to exercise the privilege of franchise and that there is
such a wide difference between a European and an Indian that contact
with the former, even for any length of time, does not fit him for the
exercise of the precious privilege.

educated persons born in civilized countries where representative
institutions prevail?

It was a treat to read your learned and able leader in today's
issue. It was not expected that there would be nothing to be said
against the franchise petition. That would be a wondrous—I was
almost going to say, superhuman—thing that would not have its two
sides, in these modern times. On the same principle, Sir George
Chesney is not the only writer who would serve your purpose. Sir
Henry Sumner Maine was also, after all, a mortal. It is, therefore, only
natural that his theories and conclusions should be contested. There
seems to be no escape for a mortal from “the pairs of opposites”. I
would, however, without for the present presenting the other aspect of
the case, beg leave to revert to the matter on some future occasion.
The object of writing this letter is to “surprise” you. The State
of Mysore, I am glad to say, has given the political franchise rights to
its subjects. I take the following from a newspaper report :

Natal Mercury, 7-7-1894, commenting on the petition presented to the Natal Legis-
lative Council by the Indian community in connection with the Franchise Law Ame-
ndment Bill. It was argued that Parliamentary Government was very different from any
form of representation known to the village communities of India. The Bill excluded
Indians from the franchise on the ground that they had not exercised the franchise in
their own country. The Indians pleaded that they had done so from ancient times in
their village communities. But The Natal Mercury contested this view, and that of Sir
Henry Sumner Maine, in his Village-Communities in the East and West, that Indian
had been familiar with representative institutions almost from time immemorial. It
maintained that Indian village-communities had nothing to do with political repre-
sentation but only with the legal question of land tenure. It argued that village-
community life was common to all primitive peoples and, if anything, proved the
backwardness of a people, and quoted General Sir George Chesney's views in The
Nineteenth Century to the effect that Indians were still in their political infancy.

University, ordinarily residing in the taluk, have been given the privilege of
electing, as well as of being elected. Thus property as well as intelligence will
be represented in the Assembly. Further, it has also been specified that public
associations, municipalities and the local boards may also elect members. The
total number of members fixed is 347, and these members are elected by nearly
4,000 electors.
Sir, I appeal to your good sense, and ask you, will you not better
serve humanity by collecting and pointing our points of resemblances
between the two peoples than by holding out to the public gaze points
of contrasts, often far-fetched or merely imaginary, that can but
arouse the worst feeling of a man, while they can do nobody any real
good? I hardly think it can be to your interest to sow the seeds of
jealousy and animosity between the two nations. That, I doubt not, is
in your power, as it is in anybody's, more or less. But a thing far
higher and far nobler, too, lies within your reach—a thing that would
bring you not only greatness, but goodness, and what is more, the
gratitude of a nation that has not been crushed under 1,200 years'
tyranny and oppression, a fact by itself a miracle,—and that thing is to
educate rightly the Colony about India and its people.

some time (even thirty years), become free. Some are Indians under
indenture, and some are born and educated in the Colony, and
engaged in various pursuits of life as attorneys’ clerks, compounders,
compositors, photographers, schoolmasters, etc. Again, some of Your
Lordship's Petitioners have considerable landed property in the

the Honourable the Legislative Assembly. And a few have got
sufficient property qualifications, but have not been able to get their
names on the Voters’ Roll for some cause or other.
3* Your Lordship’s Petitioners hereby approach Your Lordship
with regard to the Franchise Law Amendment Bill, which was
introduced last session by the Honourable Sir John Robinson, the
Prime Minister of the Colony, and which has passed the third reading
in the Honourable Legislative Council, and received the assent of His

disqualification of all the persons of Asiatic extraction, who have
settled in the Colony, to vote at the Parliamentary elections. It,
however, excepts those who are already rightly placed on the Voters'
Lists.
5* Your Lordship's Petitioners crave leave to give a short history
of the movement carried on to obtain redress through the constituted
authorities in the Colony.
6* It was when the Franchise Law Amendment Bill had passed
the second reading that Your Lordship's Petitioners first approached
the Honourable the Legislative Assembly. When Your Lordship's
Petitioners became aware that two days after the second reading, the
Bill had passed the committee stage, and a day after, it would pass the
third reading it was impossible to present a petition to the Hon. the
Legislative Aeeembly unless the third reading was postponed. Your
Lordship's Petitioners, therefore, sent a telegraphic petition
1 to the
Honourable the Legislative Assembly, requesting that a postponement
should be granted. The postponement was very graciously granted for
one day. In that one day, about 500 Indians signed a petition which
was next day presented to the Honourable the Legislative Assembly.
In Maritzburg, a deputation waited upon some Honourable Members
of the Honourable House, including the Premier and the Attorney-
General. The deputation was very courteously received and given a
patient hearing. Most of the Honourable Members waited upon more
or less admitted the justice of the prayer contained in the said petition,
though all said that it was presented too late. The Honourable Prime
Minister, in order that it might be studied, asked leave to postpone the
third reading for four days. It might be mentioned also that
telegraphic petitions were sent to the Honourable the Legislative
Council from Verulam, Richmond Road and other places, endorsing
the said petition. But they were ruled out of order on the ground they
were not presented through a Member of the House. Your Lordship's
Petitioners have not annexed hereto the various petitions referred to,
as these will no doubt be sent to Your Lordship by the Government. 
7* Four days, after the presentation of the petition, i.e., on the
2nd July, 1894, Monday, the Bill was, contrary to your Petitioners'
expectations and much to their regret, read a third time.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 163, 1, 2, 368319) 4. The Bill above referred to has for its object the disqualification of all the persons of Asiatic extraction, who have settled in the Colony, to vote at the Parliamentary elections.

upon sent a petition to the Honourable the Legislative Council, which
was presented through the Honourable Mr* Campbell, but the petition
was ruled not in order, because it contained references to the
Honourable the Legislative Assembly, and the Bill was read a second
time. Your Lordship's Petitioners, as soon as they knew this, lost no
time in addressing another petition to the Honourable Council, which
was sent on the Thursday following, and was presented on Friday
through the same Honourable Member. In the meanwhile, i.e., within
one day after the second reading, the Bill had passed the committee
stage. The Honourable Mr* Campbell moved the postponement of the
third reading of the Bill, in order that the petition last mentioned
might be considered. The motion, however, was not carried on the
ground that the petition was presented too late. The Bill had been
hardly four days before the Honourable Council, as Your Lordship
will notice. Your Lordship's Petitioners may also mention that a
deputation was appointed by the leading members of the Indian
community to wait upon His Excellency the Honourable Sir Walter F*
Hely-Hutchinson, who very kindly and courteously received the
deputation. In order to know the individual opinions of the
Honourable Members of the two Houses, a Committee of Indians sent
a printed circular 
1to the Honourable Members requesting them to
answer certain questions. Your Petitioners append hereto the Circular
and the Memorandum containing the questions. So far, only one
Honourable Member has been good enough to send a reply, but he,
too, has not answered the questions.
9* Before proceeding to criticize the Franchise Bill, Your
Lordship's Petitioners would beg to dispose of one point that has been
used against Your Lordship's Petitioners, namely, that they
approached the Honourable Assembly too late. As to this, your
Petitioners would simply state that they were not technically too late,
and that the issues involved were, and are, so important, and the Bill so
vitally affected and affects Her Majesty’s Indian subjects that the
Government, or the Honourable the Legislative Council and the
Legislative Assembly  might well have reconsidered their decision and
thoroughly investigated Your Lordship’s Petitioners’ case before
allowing the Bill to pass the third reading.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 164, 1, 2, 370753) 8. On the Tuesday following, Your Lordship's Petitioners there- upon sent a petition to the Honourable the Legislative Council, which was presented through the Honourable Mr. Campbell, but the petition was ruled not in order, because it contained references to the Honourable the Legislative Assembly, and the Bill was read a second time.

New Para:  10* During the debate it was stated, as also it is stated in the
preamble of the Bill, that the Asiatic communities have never
exercised the privilege of Franchise, and it was stated further, during
the debate, that the Asiatics were not fit to exercise the Franchise.
These were, then, the two chief reasons alleged for the exclusion of the
Indians from the privilege of the Franchise. Your Petitioners venture
to believe that the petition to the Honourable Assembly sufficiently
disposes of the two contentions above-mentioned.
11* Although it was not openly acknowledged that the two
objections to the Asiatics exercising the Franchise privilege had fallen
through, it seemed to be tacitly recognized that such was the case, for
it was more openly declared in the third reading of the Bill in the
Honourable Assembly, that the exclusion was to be justified, not on
moral and equitable grounds, as was contended at the time of the
second reading, but on purely political grounds. It was said that, if the
Indians were allowed to vote, their vote would swamp the European
vote, and that there would be a Government by the Asiatics instead of
by the Europeans.
12* Your Lordship's Petitioners venture [to submit], with the
greatest deference to both the Honourable Houses, that the above fears
are entirely groundless. Even at the present moment there are very few
Indian electors as compared with European electors. The Indians who
come under indenture cannot possibly have the sufficient property
qualifications to be qualified for voting during their term of
indenture, and for many more years afterwards. It is, moreover, a
notorious fact that those who come on their own means do not remain
for good in the Colony, but after a certain number of years, return
home and are replaced by other Indians. Thus, so far as the trading
community is concerned, the number of votes would, as a rule, always
remain unchanged. Another fact, too, cannot be lost sight of, viz., that
the Indians do not take such an active interest in the political affairs of
the Colony as the European section of the community. It seems that
there are 45,000 Europeans, and the same number of Indians; that fact
alone shows how material is the difference between the European and
the Indian vote. And Your Lordship’s Petitioners submit that it is well
nigh impossible that any Indian can hope to enter into the Natal
Parliament for generations to come. This, Your Lordship's Petitioners
humbly submit, hardly needs any proof to support it.

During the debate it was stated, as also it is stated in the preamble of the Bill, that the Asiatic communities have never exercised the privilege of Franchise, and it was stated further, during the debate, that the Asiatics were not fit to exercise the Franchise.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 165, 1, 3, 373505) These were, then, the two chief reasons alleged for the exclusion of the Indians from the privilege of the Franchise.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 165, 1, 4, 373623) Your Petitioners venture to believe that the petition to the Honourable Assembly sufficiently disposes of the two contentions above-mentioned.

government of the Colony, and more especially the government of
themselves?
14* Your Lordship’s Petitioners venture to submit that the Bill is
admittedly retrograde in character and that it is manifestly unjust.
15* The very fact that those who are rightly on the Voters' List
are to be allowed to remain there, at once, in your Petitioners' humble
opinion, recognizes the ability of your Petitioners to understand the
privilege and the responsibility attached to the exercise of the
Franchise. Your Lordship's Petitioners cannot believe that they are
allowed to remain on the List even though they are not fit to vote, as
was attempted to be shown in the course of the debate.
16* It has also been said that Clause II of the Bill fully meets the
ends of justice. Your Petitioners submit that it does not. On the
contrary, it injures the feelings of both those who are on the List and
those who are not.
17* It is little comfort to those who are already on the List to
know that they may vote, while their children never can, no matter
how well educated and well qualified they may be. Indian parents who
settle in the Colony will have, if the Bill becomes law, the best stimulus
to give higher education to their children taken away from them.
They would hardly like to see their sons pariahs of society, without a
status or without any ambition in life. Even wealth becomes useless if
it gives a man no place in society. The very aim with which men
collect wealth is thus nipped in the bud.
18* And the Second Clause vexes those who have been in the
Colony already to know that, while their brethren, who are in no way
superior to them, by a chance retain the right to vote, they themselves
cannot vote simply because, perhaps, owing to circumstances entirely
beyond their control, they have not been able to get their names on
the Voters' List. The Bill thus makes between Indian British subjects of
the same class an invidious distinction based on accidental
circumstances.
19* It has also been hinted that the justice done by the Second
Clause is not gratefully acknowledged by your Petitioners. But, with
the greatest respect to the just intentions of the Government in
introducing the Second Clause, Your Lordship's Petitioners have failed

20* Your Lordship's Petitioners have noticed with shame and
sorrow the zealous attempt made to compare your Petitioners with the
Natives of South Africa. Very often it was said the Natives had a better
claim to vote, if the Indians had any, simply because they were British
subjects. Your Lordship's Petitioners would not enter into a discussion
of the comparison, but would draw Your Lordship's attention to the
Royal Proclamation of 1858, as also to Your Lordship's own personal
experience of the Indian nation. Your Petitioners need hardly point
out the marked difference that exists between the Governments of
Indian British subjects and Native British subjects.
21* There are, at the present moment, hundreds of educated
Indians, signatures of some of whom appear in the petition, who
would not be able to vote at the Parliamentary elections if the Bill
became law. Your Petitioners fully trust that Your Lordship will never
advise Her Most Gracious Majesty to sanction a Bill that would cause
such a grave injustice to any section of British subjects.
22* In the Natal Government Gazette of March 27, 1894, Your
Lordship's Petitioners find, from the Indian Immigrants School Board
Report for 1893, that there were 26 schools and 2,589 scholars
studying in the schools that year. Your Petitioners respectfully submit
that these boys, who are many of them born in the Colony, are
entirely brought up after the European style. They, in later life, come
in contact chiefly with the European community, and therefore, in
every respect, become as fit for the Franchise privilege as any
European, unless there is something radically wanting in them to
compete with the Europeans in educational ability. That they are not
incompetent, Your Lordship's Petitioners submit, has been proved
beyond doubt by the best authorities on such subjects. The results,
alike in India as in England, of the competition between English and
Indian students, furnish ample proof of the Indian's ability to
successfully compete with the European. Your Lordship's Petitioners
purposely refrain from quoting extracts from the evidence given
before the Parliamentary committees, or from great writers on the
above head,  because that would almost look like carrying coals to
Newcastle. If, then, your Petitioners humbly venture to claim a vote

23* Your Lordship's Petitioners here have to note with gratitude
that the Hon. Mr* Campbell and the Hon. Mr* Don saw and remarked
about the injustice that would be done to those Indians who come to
the Colony on their own means, but they, too, seem to think, with the
other Honourable Members, that those who come under indenture
should never get the vote. Your Lordship's Petitioners, while they
admit (although they cannot help remarking that poverty should be
no crime if a man is otherwise fit) that the indentured Indians, while
under indenture, may not have the right to vote, they respectfully
submit that even these men should not for ever be deprived from
voting if they acquire the sufficient qualifications in later life. Such
men who come here are, as a rule, ablebodied and young; they come
under European influences, and while they are under indenture, and
especially after they become free, rapidly begin to assimilate
themselves to the European civilization, and develop into full
Colonists. They are admitted to be very useful, in fact, invaluable
people, who live quietly and peacefully. It may be remarked that most
of the educated Indian youths, who are now in the Civil Service as
clerks and interpreters, or outside it as schoolmasters, teachers or
attorneys' clerks, have come to the Colony under indenture. It is
submitted that it would be cruel not to allow them, or their children, to
vote and to have a voice in their own government at any rate. Your
Petitioners submit that the fact alone that a person is of Asiatic
extraction or has once been under indenture, should not be a bar to
political freedom and political privileges, if he is or becomes otherwise
duly fit and qualified.
24* Your Lordship's Petitioners beg to draw Your Lordship's
attention to the anomaly that the Bill would rank the Indian lower than
the rawest Native. For while the rawest Native can become
emancipated if he acquires the proper qualifications, the Indian British
subject who is now entitled to vote would be so disenfranchised that he
can  never again become emancipated, no matter how capable he
becomes in after life, or how capable he is at the time of
disenfranchisement.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 169, 4, 15, 385596) I am of the opinion that only those Indians who have abandoned all claim for themselves and their families for a free return passage to India are justly entitled to the Franchise.

New Para:  As regards the proposal to exclude from the exercise of the Franchise
all persons of every nationality or race which is not in every respect under the
common law of the Colony, this is a provision evidently aimed at the
electoral rights at present enjoyed by the Indian and Creole population of this
Colony. As I have already stated in my report on Bill No. 12, I cannot
recognize the justice or expediency of such a measure.
27* Thus is happens that, under a freer constitution in the
Colony, that should include Your Lordship's Petitioners also, the First
Responsible Ministry, your Petitioners regret to say, have attempted to
make your Petitioners less free, to disenfranchise them wholesale. In
the face of the fact that, under the old regime, a far less bold attempt
to restrict the rights of your Petitioners did not receive countenance
from the Home Government, your Petitioners have every hope that the
present attempt will meet with the same fate, and justice done to Your
Lordship's Petitioners.

between the European section of the community and the Indian. The
Indian is hated and shunned by the European. He is often needlessly

want those Indians who come on their own means and they want the
indentured Indians very badly; but they would require, if they could,
the indentured Indian to  return to India after his term of indenture. A
perfect leonine partnership! They know very well that they cannot do
this at once—so they have begun with the Franchise Bill. They want to
feel the pulse of the Home Government on the question. One member
of the Assembly writes to me  that he does  not  believe that the
HomeGovernment would sanction the Bill. I need hardly say how
important it is for the Indian community that the Bill should not
receive the sanction.
Natal is not a bad place for the Indians. Good many Indian
traders earn a respectable living here. The Bill, if it became law, would
be a very great blow to further Indian enterprise.
Of course, I may state again, as I have done once, that there is
not the slightest probability of the government of the Natives passing
from the Europeans to the Indians. This is simply meant to frighten
the Home Government. Those who live here—including the
Government—know very well that such a thing will never happen.
They do not want the Indians to elect white members—2 or 3—who
may look after their interests in the Parliament, so that the
Government may work their way towards the destruction of the
Indians without any opposition whatever.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 174, 1, 11, 395140) The Bill, if it became law, would be a very great blow to further Indian enterprise.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 174, 1, 12, 395225) Of course, I may state again, as I have done once, that there is not the slightest probability of the government of the Natives passing from the Europeans to the Indians.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 174, 1, 13, 395396) This is simply meant to frighten the Home Government.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 174, 1, 14, 395450) Those who live here—including the Government—know very well that such a thing will never happen.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 174, 1, 15, 395547) They do not want the Indians to elect white members—2 or 3—who may look after their interests in the Parliament, so that the Government may work their way towards the destruction of the Indians without any opposition whatever.

New Para:  DEAR MRS. LEWIS
1,
I thank you for your kind letter of the 27th June.
After I wrote to you last,
2 I had occasion to come in contact with
a doctor in Pretoria. He seemed to be the only gentleman in addition
to another who took interest in theosophical subjects. I gave him The
Perfect Way to read. He liked it so much that he wished me to get
another copy for him. I made him a present of my copy. I would
therefore thank you if you will kindly send me a copy of The Perfect
Way. I would send you the money next time. I have no time to do so
this time.
I have settled in Durban for practice as an advocate. More of
this you will know from Mr* Oldfield.
During my stay here I intend to spread as much as possible
information about theosophy. (To me there is little difference between
Theosophy and Esoteric Christianity). I have therefore sent out letters

keeping of the books and the sale proceeds. 5 copies of The Perfect
Way, 5 of Clothed with the Sun and 10 of The New Gospel of
Interpretation and other books may be sent to me. If sufficient
interest is evoked, I would add on the advertising charges also to the
cost price. The cost price of the books should be stated in each case in
the letter of instruction.
If it is necessary to read this letter or a portion thereof to the
Union, you can do so. I hope you will be able to persuade the Union
or those in authority to accede to the above proposal.
If you do not think much of the Souls, what position is the book
to occupy in respectable literature? If the author has written what is
absolutely true from personal observation, the book cannot be lightly
treated. If it is an attempt to delude the people into a belief in real
truths by fascinating falsehoods, the book deserves the highest
condemnation possible. For we will not learn truth by means of
falsehoods. Of course I write this without meaning the slightest
disrespect for the author of whom I know nothing. She may be a lady
of the highest probity and truth. I only repeat that to appreciate the
Souls, acquaintance with the author's character is absolutely necessary.
I could get many signatures to the petition you enclosed. But I
am afraid the Natal signatures would be quite useless. Is it not a sad
commentary on the morality of the age that a most important, and yet
most harmless and elevating, movement should not receive good
support? At times when I think of these things, I thoroughly despair
of fruits of works. A verse from the Bhagavad Gita saves me from
utter despair and consequent inaction—a verse which enjoins freedom
from attachment to fruits of works.

New Para:  SIR,
I would, with your permission, venture to make a few remarks
on your leader, entitled “Rammysammy”, in your issue of the 22nd
instant.
I have no wish to defend the article in The Times of India
noticed by you; but is not your very leader its sufficient defence?
Does not the very heading “Rammysammy” betray a studied
contempt towards the poor Indian? Is not the whole article a needless
insult to him? You are pleased to acknowledge that “India possesses
men of high culture, etc.” and yet you would not, if you could, give
them equal political power with the white man. Do you not thus make
the insult doubly insulting? If you had thought that the Indians were
not cultured, but were barbarous brutes, and on that ground denied
them political equality, there would be some excuse for your
opinions. You,  however, in order to enjoy the fullest pleasures derived
from offering an insult to an inoffensive people, must needs show that
you acknowledge them to be intelligent people and yet would keep
them under foot.
Then you have said that the Indians in the Colony are not the
same as those in India; but, Sir, you conveniently forget that they are
the brothers or descendants of the same race whom you credit with
intelligence, and have, therefore, given 
the 
opportunity, the
potentiality of becoming as capable as their more fortunate brethren

New Para:  East End of London has the potentiality of becoming Prime Minister
in free England.
You put upon the franchise petition to Lord Ripon an
interpretation it was never meant to convey. The Indians do not regret
that capable Natives can exercise the franchise. They would regret if it
were otherwise. They, however, assert that they too, if capable, should
have the right. You, in your wisdom, would not allow the Indian or the
Native the precious privilege under any circumstances, because they
have a dark skin. You would look to the exterior only. So long as the
skin is white it would not matter to you whether it conceals beneath it
poison or nectar. To you the lip-prayer of the Pharisee, because he is
one, is more acceptable than the sincere repentance of the publican,
and this, I presume, you would call Christianity. You may; it is not
Christ's.
And in spite of such opinions held by you, a respectable
newspaper in the Colony, you impute falsehood to The Times of India.
It is one thing to formulate a charge, it is another to prove it.
You end with saying that “Rammysammy” may have every
right a citizen can desire, with one exception, viz., “political power”.
Are the heading of your leader and its tenor consistent with the above
opinion? Or is it un-Christian, un-English to be consistent? “Suffer
little children to come unto me,”  said the Master. His disciples (?) in
the Colony would improve upon the saying by inserting “white”
after “little”. During the children's fete, organized by the Mayor of
Durban, I am told there was not a single coloured child to be seen in
the procession. Was this a punishment for the sin of being born of
coloured parents? Is this an incident of the qualified citizenship you
would accord to the hated “Rammysammy
 
If He came among us, will he not say to many of us, “I know
you not”? Sir, may I venture to offer a suggestion? Will you reread
your New Testament? Will you ponder over your attitude towards the
coloured population of the Colony? Will you then say you can
reconcile it with the Bible teaching or the best British traditions? If
you have washed your hands clean of both Christ and British
traditions, I can have nothing to say; I gladly withdraw what I have
written. Only it will then be a sad day for Britain and for India if you
have many followers.

New Para:  SIR,
You will greatly oblige me by allowing me to draw the attention
of your readers to an advertisement that appears in your advertisement
columns with regard to the Esoteric Christian Union. The system of
thought expounded by the books advertised is not, by any means, a
new system but a recovery of the old, presented in a form acceptable
to the modern mind. It is, moreover, a system of religion which
teaches universality, and is based on eternal verities and not on
phenomena or historical facts merely. In that system, there is no
reviling Mahomed or Buddha in order to prove the superiority of
Jesus. On the other hand, it reconciles the other religions with
Christianity which, in the opinion of the authors, is nothing but one
mode (among many) of presentation of the same eternal truth. The
many puzzles of the Old Testament find herein a solution at once
complete and satisfactory.
If there is anyone of your readers who has found the presentday
materialism and all its splendour to be insufficient for the needs of his
soul, if he has a craving for a better life, and if, under the dazzling and
bright surface of modern civilization, he finds that there is much that
is contrary to what one would expect under such a surface,  and above
all, if the modern luxuries and the ceaseless feverish activity afford no
relief, to such a one I beg to recommend the books referred to. And I
promise that, after a perusal, he will find himself a better man, even
though he may not thoroughly identify himself with the teaching.
If there is anyone who would like to have a chat on the subject,
it would afford me the greatest pleasure to have a quiet interchange of
views. In such a case, I would thank any such gentleman to
correspond with me personally. I need hardly mention that the sale of
the books is not a pecuniary concern. Could Mr* Maitland, the
President of the Union, or its agent here, afford to give them away,
they would gladly do so. In many cases, the books have been sold at

Were it possible to write to you anonymously, nothing would
have been more pleasing to me. But the statements I shall have to
make in this letter will be so grave and important that it would be
considered a sheer act of cowardice not to disclose my name. I beg,
however, to assure you that I write not from selfish motives, nor yet
from those of self-aggrandisement or of seeking notoriety. The one
and only object is to serve India, which is by accident of birth called
my native country, and to bring about better understanding between
the European section of the community and the Indian in this Colony.
The only way this can be done is to appeal to those who
represent and, at the same time, mould public opinion.
Hence, if the Europeans and the Indians live in a perpetual state
of quarrel, the blame would lie on your shoulders. If both can walk
together and live together quietly and without friction, you will receive

what the best men do the multitude will follow.”
This letter, therefore, needs no apology. It would hardly be
called impertinent.
For, to whom else could such an appeal be more aptly made, or
by whom else should it be considered more seriously than you?
To carry on an agitation in England is but a poor relief when it
can only create a greater friction between the two peoples in the
Colony. The relief, at best, could only be temporary. Unless the
Europeans in the Colony can be induced to accord the Indians a
better treatment, the Indians have a very bad time before them under
the aegis of the Responsible Government, in spite of vigilance of the
Home Government.
Without entering into details, I would deal with the Indian
question as a whole.
I suppose there can be no doubt that the Indian is a despised
being in the Colony, and that every opposition to him proceeds
directly from that hatred.
If that hatred is simply based upon his colour, then, of course,
he has no hope. The sooner he leaves the Colony the better. No matter
what he does, he will never have the white skin. If, however, it is based
upon something else, if it is based upon an ignorance of his general
character and attainments, he may hope to receive his due at the hands
of the Europeans in the Colony.
The question what use the Colony will make of the 40,000
Indians is, I submit, worthy of the most serious consideration by the
Colonists, and especially those who have the reins of Government in

powers. To root out the 40,000 Indians from the Colony seems,
without doubt, an impossible task. Most of them have settled here with
their families. No legislation that could be permissible in a British
Colony would enable the legislators to drive these men out. It may be
possible to devise a scheme to effectively check any further Indian
immigration. But apart from that, the question suggested by me is, I
submit, sufficiently serious to warrant my encroaching upon your
attention and requesting you to persue this letter without any bias.
It is for you to say whether you will lower them or raise them in
the scale of civilization, whether you will bring them down to a level
lower than what they should occupy on account of heredity, whether
you will alienate their hearts from you, or whether you will draw them
closer to you—whether, in short, you would govern them despotically
or sympathetically.
You can educate public opinion in such a way that the hatred
will be increased day by day; and you can, if you chose so to do,
educate it in such a way that the hatred would begin to subside.
I now propose to discuss the question under the following
heads:
1* Are the Indians desirable as citizens in the Colony?
2* What are they?
3* Is their present treatment in accordance with the best British
traditions, or with the principles of justice and morality, or with the
principles of Christianity?
 4* From a purely material and selfish point of view, will an
abrupt or gradual withdrawal of them from the Colony result in
substantial, lasting benefit to the Colony?

In discussing the first question, I will deal, first of all, with the
Indians employed as labourers, most of whom have come to the
Colony under indenture.
It seems to have been acknowledged by those who are supposed
to know, that the indentured Indians are indispensable for the welfare
of the Colony; whether as menials or waiters, whether as railway
servants or gardeners, they are a useful addition to the Colony. The
work that a Native cannot or would not do is cheerfully and well done
by the indentured Indian. It would seem that the Indian has helped to

New Para:  . . . and at the last, as the only thing to be done, the immigration of
Indians was entered upon, and the Legislature very wisely rendered their
support and help in furthering this all-important scheme. At the time it was
entered upon the progress and almost the existence of the Colony hung in the
balance. And now what is the result of this scheme of immigration?
Financially, £10,000 has been advanced yearly out of the Treasury of the
Colony. With what result? Just this, that no vote ever made of money to
develop the industries of the Colony, or to promote its interest in any way in
this Colony, has yielded such a financially profitable return as that shown by
the introduction of coolies as labourers into this Colony. . . . I believe the
Durban population of Europeans, had no such labour been supplied as required
for Colonial industries, would be less by at least half what it is today, and five
workmen only would be required where twenty now have employment.
Property in Durban generally would have remained at a value some 300 or 400
per cent below that which now obtains, and the lands in the Colony and other
towns, in proportion according to the value of property in Durban and coast
land, would never have realized what it now sells at.
 This gentleman is no other than Mr* Garland. In spite of such
invaluable help derived from “the coolie”, as the poor Indian is
contemptuously termed even by those who ought to know better, the
honourable gentleman goes on, ungratefully, to regret the tendency of
the Indian to settle in the Colony.

furnish us with the solid core of our armed forces in that continent, and will
supply us with thetelegraph clerks, the petty shopkeepers, the skilled
artisans, the cooks, the minor employees, the clerks, and the railway officials
needed in the civilized administration of tropical Africa. The Indian, liked by
both black and white, will serve as a link between these two divergent races.
As to the Indian traders, who are miscalled Arabs, it would
appear best to consider the objections raised to their coming to the
Colony.
From the papers, especially The Natal Mercury of 6-7-'94, and
The Natal Advertiser of 15-9-'93, the objections appear to be that they
are successful traders, and that, their mode of living being very simple,
they compete with the European trader in petty trades. I dismiss as
unworthy of consideration the generalizations from rare particular
instances that the Indians resort to sharp practices. As to the particular
instances of insolvency, I would only say, without meaning in the least
to defend them, “Let those that are without sin first cast a stone”.
Please examine the records of the Insolvency Court.
Coming to the serious objection as to successful competition, I
believe it is true. But is that a reason for driving them out of the
Colony? Will such a method commend itself to a body of civilized
men? What is it that makes them so successful competitors? He who
runs may see that it is nothing but their habits, which are extremely
simple, though not barbarous, as The Natal Advertiser would have it.
The chiefest element of their success, in my humble opinion, is their
total abstinence from drink and its attendant evils. That habit at once
causes an enormous saving of money. Moreover, their tastes are
simple, and they are satisfied with comparatively small profits, because
they do not keep uselessly large establishments. In short, they earn
their bread by the sweat of their brow. It is difficult to see how these
facts can be urged as an objection to their stopping in the Colony. Of
course, they do not gamble, as a rule do not smoke, and can put up
with little inconveniences; work more than eight hours a day. Should
they be expected to, is it desirable that they should, abandon these
virtues, and contract the terrible vices under which the Western nations
are groaning, so that they may be permitted to live in the Colony
without molestation?
It will be best, also, to consider the common objection to the

New Para:  much that is said against their insanitary habits proceeds merely out of
spite and hatred, there is no denying that in this respect they are  not
everything that could be desired. That, however, never can be a reason
for their expulsion from the Colony. They are not hopelessly beyond
reform in this branch. A strict, yet just and merciful, operation  of the
sanitary law can, I submit, effectually cope with the evil, and even
eradicate it. Nor is the evil so great as to require any drastic measures.
Their personal habits, it would appear, are not dirty, except in the case
of the indentured Indians, who are too poor to attend to personal
cleanliness. I may be allowed to say, from personal experience, that
the trading community are compelled by their religion to bathe once
a week at least, and have to perform ablutions, i.e., wash their faces
and hands up to the elbows, and their feet, every time they offer
prayers. They are supposed to offer prayers four times a day, and
there are very few who fail to do so at least twice a day.
It will, I hope,  be readily admitted that they are exceptionally
free from those vices which render a community a danger to society.
They yield to no one in their obedience to constitutional authority.
They are never a political danger. And except the ruffians who are
sometimes picked out, of course unknowingly, by the immigration
agents at Calcutta and Madras, they seem to be free from the highly
grievous offences. I regret that my inability to compare the Criminal
Court statistics prevents me from making any further observations on
this point. I will, however, beg leave to quote from the Natal Almanac:
“It must be said for the Indian population that it is on the whole
orderly and law-abiding.”
 I submit that the above facts show that the Indian labourers are
not only desirable but useful citizens of the Colony, and also
absolutely essential to its well-being, and that the traders have nothing
in them that should render them undesirable in the Colony.
As to these latter, before quitting the subject, I would further add
that they are a veritable blessing  to the poor portion of the European
community, in so far as by their keen competition they keep down the
prices of necessities of life; and knowing their language and under-
standing their customs, are indispensable to the Indian labourers,
whose wants they study and supply, and whom they can deal with on
better terms than the Europeans.

writing on this subject will have been served if only it stimulates a
study of India and its people; for, I thoroughly believe that one half,

South Africa result from want of information about India.

portion of my letter as an insult. To such I say with the greatest
deference: “I am aware that you know a great deal about India. But is
it not a cruel fact that the Colony is not the better for your
knowledge? Certainly the Indians are not, unless the knowledge
acquired by you is entirely different from and opposed to that
acquired by others who have worked in  the same field. Again,
although this humble effort is directly addressed to you, it is supposed
to reach many others, in fact all who have an interest in the future of
the Colony with its present inhabitants.”

Indo-Germanic stock, from which the Brahman, the Rajput, and the
Englishman alike descend. Its earliest home visible to history was in Central
Asia. From that common camping ground certain branches of the race started
for the East, others for the West. One of the Western offshoots founded the
Persian Kingdom; another built Athens and Lacedaemon, and became the
Hellenic nation; a third went on to Italy and reared the city on the seven hills,
which grew into Imperial Rome. A distant colony of the same race excavated
the silver ores of prehistoric Spain; and when we first catch a sight of ancient
England, we see an Aryan settlement, fishing in wattle canoes and working the
tin mines of Cornwall.

supposed to have consulted all the authorities, without a shadow of
doubt makes the above unqualified assertion. If then I err, I err in

problems, such as the compatibility of evil with the goodness of God, and the
unequal distribution of happiness and misery in this life. Brahmin philosophy
has exhausted the possible solutions of these difficulties, and of most of the
other great problems which have since perplexed the Greek and Roman sage,
mediaeval schoolman and modern man of science (the italics are mine). The
various hypotheses of creation, arrangement and development were each
elaborated and the views of physiologists at the present day are a return with
new lights to the evolution theory of Kapila
2 (the italics are mine). The works
on religion published in the native language in India in 1877 numbered 1192,
besides 56 on mental and moral philosophy. In 1882 the total had risen to
1545 on religion and 153 on mental and moral philosophy.

New Para:  If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed
some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the greatest problems
of life, and has found solutions of some of them which well deserve the
attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant—I should point to
India; and if I were to ask myself from what literature we have here in
Europe,we who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of
Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw that
corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect,
more comprehensive, more universal, in fact, more truly human—a life not for
this life only, but a transfigured and eternal life—again I should point to India.
The German philosopher, Schopenhauer, thus 
adds his
testimony to the grandeur of Indian philosophy as contained in the
Upanishads:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 193, 2, 3, 434997) If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant—I should point to India; and if I were to ask myself from what literature we have here in Europe,we who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw that corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more universal, in fact, more truly human—a life not for this life only, but a transfigured and eternal life—again I should point to India.

New Para:  From every sentence deep, original and sublime thoughts arise, and the
whole is pervaded by a high and holy and earnest spirit. Indian air surrounds
us, and original thoughts of kindred spirits ... In the whole world there is no
study, except that of the originals, so beneficial and so elevating as that of the

New Para:  The science of language, indeed, had been reduced in India to
fundamental principles at a time when the grammarians of the West still
treated it on the basis of accidental resemblances, and modern philosophy
dates from the study of Sanskrit by European scholars. . . The grammar of
Panini
2 stands supreme among the grammars of the world. . . It arranges in
logical harmony the whole phenomena which the Sanskrit language presents,
and stands forth as one of the most splendid achievements of human invention
and industry.
Speaking on the same department of science, Sir H* S* Maine, in
his Rede lecture, published in the latest edition of the Village-
Communities, says :

New Para:  Jurisprudence because, if it ever exists, its area will be so much wider than the
field of law. For India not only contains (or to speak more accurately, did
contain) an Aryan language older than any other descendant of the common
mother tongue, and a variety of names of natural objects less perfectly
crystallized than elsewhere into fabulous personages, but it includes a whole
world of Aryan institutions, Aryan customs, Aryan laws Aryan ideas, Aryan,
beliefs, in a far earlier stage of growth and development than any which

Of Indian astronomy the same historian says:

New Para:  The medical science of the Brahmins (continues the eminent historian)
was also an independent development. . . . The specific diseases whose names
occur in Panini’s grammar indicate that medical studies had made progress
before his time (350 B.C*.). . . . Arabic medicine was founded on the
translations from the Sanskrit treatises. . . . European medicine down to the
17th century was based upon the Arabic. . . . . The number of medical works

New Para:  There are some subjects too sacred for analysis, or even for words. And
I now know that there is a human structure so exquisitely fine or unearthly, as
to lift it into this holy domain. . . . The Taj is built of a light creamy marble,
so that it does not chill one as pure cold white marble does. It is warm and
sympathetic as a woman. . . . One great critic has freely called the Taj  a
feminine structure. There is nothing masculine about it, says he; its charms are
all feminine. This creamy marble is inlaid with fine black marble lines, the
entire Koran, in Arabic letters, it is said, being thus interwoven. . . Till the
day I die, amid mountain streams  or moonlight strolls in the forest, wherever
and whenever the moon comes, when all that is most sacred, most elevated and
most pure recur to shed their radiance upon the tranquil mind, there will be
found among my treasures the memory of that lovely charm—the Taj.
Nor has India been without its laws, codified or otherwise. The
Institutes of Manu have always been noted for their justice and
precision. So much does Sir H* S* Maine seem to have been struck
with their equity that he calls them “an ideal picture of that which, in
the view of the Brahmins, ought to be the law”. Mr* Pincott, writing in
1891 in The National Review, alludes to them as “the philosophical
precepts of Manu”.

good system of agriculture, if unrivalled manufacturers, if a capacity to produce
what convenience and luxury demand, if the establishment of schools for
reading and writing, if the general practice of kindness and hospitality, and,
above all, if a scrupulous respect and delicacy towards the female sex, are
amongst the points that denote a civilized people, then the Hindus are not
inferior in civilization to the people of Europe.

New Para:  reply to the objection, that other classes do not fare much better in this
respect, especially if and when they are placed in the position of the
unfortunate Indians. And yet, I am afraid, I shall have to fall back
upon argument of that sort. Much as I would wish them to be
otherwise, I confess my utter inability to prove that they are more than
human. They come to Natal on starvation wages (I mean here the
indentured Indians).
They find themselves placed in a strange position and amid
uncongenial surroundings. The moment they leave India they remain
throughout life, if they settle in the Colony, without any moral
education. Whether they are Hindus or Mahommedans, they are
absolutely without any moral or religious instruction worthy of the
name. They have not learned enough to educate themselves without
any outside help. Placed thus, they are apt to yield to the slightest
temptation to tell a lie. After some time, lying with them becomes a
habit and a disease. They would lie without any reason, without any
prospect of bettering themselves materially, indeed, without knowing
what they are doing. They reach a stage in life when their moral
faculties have completely collapsed owing to neglect. There is also a
very sad form of lying. They cannot dare tell the truth, even for their
wantonly ill-treated brother, for fear of receiving ill-treatment from
their master. They are not philosophic enough to look with
equanimity on the threatened reduction in their miserable rations and
serve corporal punishment, did they dare to give evidence against their
master. Are these men, then, more to be despised than pitied? Are they
to be treated as scoundrels, deserving no mercy, or are they to be
treated as helpless creatures, badly in need of sympathy? Is there any
class of people who would not do as they are doing under similar
circumstances?
But I will be asked what I can have to say in defence of the
traders, who, too, are equally good liars. As to this, I beg to submit that
the charge against them is without foundation, and that they do not lie
more than the other classes do for the purposes of trade or law. They
are very much misunderstood; in the first place, because they cannot
speak the English language, and secondly, because the interpretation
is very defective, through no fault of the interpreters. The interpreters
are expected to perform the Herculean task of interpreting
successfully in four languages, viz., Tamil, Telugu, Hindustani and
Gujarati. The trading Indian invariably speaks Hindustani or Gujarati.

interpreters, with one exception, speak the local Hindustani, which is a
grotesque mixture of Tamil, Gujarati and other Indian languages,
clothed in extremely bad Hindustani grammar. Very naturally, the
interpreter has to argue with the witness before he can get at his
meaning. While the process is going on, the judge grows impatient,
and thinks that the witness is prevaricating. The poor interpreter, if
questioned, true to human nature, in order to conceal his defective
knowledge ofthe language, says the witness does not give straight
answers. The poor witness has no opportunity of setting himself right.
In the case of the Gujarati speakers the matter is still more serious.
There is not a single Gujarati interpreter in the Courts. The interpreter,
after great difficulty,  manages to get at the sense only of what the
witness is speaking. I have myself seen a Gujarati-speaking witness
struggling to make himself understood, and the interpreter struggling
to understand the Gujarati-Hindustani. Indeed, it speaks volumes for
the acuteness of the interpreters in extracting even the sense from a

New Para:  In order to answer the third question, “Is their present treatment
in accordance with the best British traditions, or with the principles of
justice and morality, or with the principles of Christianity?” it will be
necessary to enquire what their treatment is. I think it will be readily
granted that the Indian is bitterly hated in the Colony. The man in the
street hates him, curses him, spits upon him, and often pushes him off
the footpath. The Press cannot find a sufficiently strong word in the
best English dictionary to damn him with. Here are a few samples :
“The real canker that is eating into the very vitals of the
community”; “these parasites”; “Wily, wretched, semi-barbarous
Asiatics”; “a thing black and lean and a long  way from clean, which
they call the accursed Hindoo”; “he is chock-full of vice, and he lives
upon rice.... I heartily cuss the Hindoo”; “squalid coolies with
truthless tongues and artful ways”. The Press almost unanimously
refuses to call the Indian by his proper name. He is “Ramsamy”; he
is “Mr* Sammy”; he is “Mr* Coolie”; he is “he black man”. And
these offensive epithets have become so common that they (at any rate
one of them, “coolie) are used even in the sacred precincts of the

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 200, 3, 16, 454490) The man in the street hates him, curses him, spits upon him, and often pushes him off the footpath.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 200, 3, 17, 454590) The Press cannot find a sufficiently strong word in the best English dictionary to damn him with.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 200, 3, 18, 454688) Here are a few samples : “The real canker that is eating into the very vitals of the community”; “these parasites”; “Wily, wretched, semi-barbarous Asiatics”; “a thing black and lean and a long way from clean, which they call the accursed Hindoo”; “he is chock-full of vice, and he lives upon rice....
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 200, 3, 19, 454990) I heartily cuss the Hindoo”; “squalid coolies with truthless tongues and artful ways”.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 200, 3, 20, 455077) The Press almost unanimously refuses to call the Indian by his proper name.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 200, 3, 21, 455153) He is “Ramsamy”; he is “Mr. Sammy”; he is “Mr. Coolie”; he is “he black man”.

any and every Indian. The public men, too, seem to use the word
freely. I have often heard the painful expressio “coolie clerk” from
the mouths of men who ought to know better. The expression is a
contradiction in terms and is extremely offensive to those to whom it
is applied. But then, in this Colony the Indian is a creature without
feelings!
The tramcars are not for the Indians. The railway officialsmay
treat the Indians as beasts. No matter how clean, his very sight is such
an offence to every white man in the Colony that he would object to
sit, even for a short time, in the same compartment with the Indian.
The  hotels shut their doors against them. I know instances of
respectable Indians having been denied a night's lodging in an hotel.
Even the public baths are not for the Indians, no matter who they are.
If I am to depend upon one-tenth of the reports that I have
received with regard to the treatment of the indentured Indians on the
various estates, it would form a terrible indictment against the
humanity of the masters on the estates and the care taken by the
Protector of Indian immigrants. This, however, is a subject which my
extremely limited experience of it precludes me from making further
remarks upon.
The Vagrant Law is needlessly oppressive, and often puts
respectable Indians in a very awkward position.
Add to this the rumours that are rife in the air, to the effect that
they should be made, or induced, to live in Locations. It may be
merely an intention; none the less, it is an index of the feeling of the
European Colonists against the Indians. I beseech you to picture to
yourself the state the Indian would be in in Natal if it were possible to
carry out all suchintentions.
Now, is this treatment in consonance with the British traditions
of justice, or morality, or Christianity?

worth which is founded on vice, on ignorance, and on misery, which we can hold by
violating the most sacred duties which as governors we owe to the governed, which as

intellectual light we owe to a race debased by three thousand years of despotism and
priestcraft? We are free, we are civilized, to little purpose, if we grudge to any portion
of the human race an equal measure of freedom and civilization.
I have but to refer you to writers like Mill, Burke, Bright, and
Fawcett

countence to the treatment accorded to the Indians in the Colony.
To bring a man here on starvation wages, to hold him under
bondage, and when he shows the least signs of liberty, or, is in a
position to live less miserably, to wish to send him back to his home
where he would become comparatively a stranger and perhaps unable
to earn a  living, is hardly a mark of fair play or justice characteristic
of the British nation.
That the treatment of the Indians is contrary to the teaching of
Christianity needs hardly any argument. The Man, who taught us to
love our enemies and to give our clock to the one who wanted the
coat, and to hold out the right cheek when the left was smitten, and
who swept away the distinction between the Jew and the Gentile, would
never brook a disposition that causes a man to be so proud of himself

what is their due, and what is the least that a sense of justice, unalloyed
by partiality or prejudice, should prompt you to give them.
It now remains for me only to implore you to give this matter
your earnest consideration, and to remind you (here I mean especially
the English) that Providence has put the English and the Indians
together, and has placed in the hands of the former the destinies of the
latter, and it will largely depend upon what every Englishman does
with respect to the Indian and how he treats him, whether the putting
together will result in an ever lasting union brought  about by broad
sympathy, love, free mutual intercourse, and also a right knowledge of
the Indian character, or whether the putting together will simply last so
long as the English have sufficient resources to keep the Indians
under check, and the naturally mild Indians have not been vexed into
active opposition to the foreign yoke. I have, further, to remind you
that the English in England have shown by their writings, speeches
and deeds that they mean to unify the hearts of the two peoples, that
they do not believe in colour distinctions, and that they will raise India
with them rather than rise upon its ruins. In support of this I beg to
refer you to Bright, Fawcett, Bradlaugh, Gladstone, Wedderburn,
Pincott, Ripon, Reay, Northbrooke, Dufferin, and a host of other
eminent Englishmen who represent public opinion. The very fact of
an English constituency returning an Indian to the British Ho
1use of
Commons, in spite of the expressed wish to the contrary of the then
Prime Minister, and almost the whole British Press, both Conservative
and Liberal, congratulating the Indian member on the success, and
expressing its approval of the unique event, and the whole House
again, both Conservative and Liberal, according him a warm
welcome—this fact alone, I submit, supports my statement. Will you,
then, follow them, or will you strike out a new path? Will you promote
unity, “which is the condition of progress”, or will you promote
discord, “which is the condition of degradation”?
In conclusion, I beg of you to receive the above in the same

Whether you be a clergyman, editor, public man, merchant or

clergyman, inasmuch as you represent the teaching of Jesus, it must be
your duty to see that you are in no way, directly or indirectly,
countenancing a treatment of your fellow-beings that would not be
pleasing to Jesus. If you are an editor of a news-paper, the
responsibility is equally great. Whether you are using your influence
as a journalist to the evolution or degradation of humanity will
depend upon whether you are encouraging division among class and
class or striving after union. The same remarks will apply to you as a
public man. If you are a merchant or lawyer, you have then too, a
duty to discharge towards your customers and clients from whom you
derive a considerable pecuniary advantage. It is for you to treat them
as dogs or fellow-beings demanding your symapathy in the cruel
persecution that they are put to owing to the prevalent ignorance
about the Indians in the Colony. Coming as you do in comparatively
close contact with them, you have, no doubt, the opportunity and
incentive to study them. Looked at from a sympathetic standpoint,
they would perhaps show themselves to you as they have been seen by
scores and hundreds of Europeans who had the opportunity to study
them, and who used it alright.
Your opinion is solicited with a view to ascertaining if there are
many Europeans in the Colony who would actively sympathize with
and feel for the Indians in the Colony, assuming that their treatment is
not all that could be desired.

New Para:  SIR
You will oblige me by letting me draw the attention of your rea-
ders to the notice that appears in your advertisement columns about
the Esoteric Christian Union and the London Vegetarian Society.
The system represented by the Union establishes the unity and
common source of all the great religions of the world, and points out,
as the books advertised will amply show, the utter inadequacy of
materialism which boasts of having given the world a civilization
which was never witnessed before, and which is alleged to The Natal
Advertiser have done the greatest good to humanity, all the while
conveniently forgetting that its greatest achievenments are the
invention of the most terrible weapons of destruction, the awful
growth of anarchism, the frightful disputes between capital and labour
and the wanton and diabolical cruelty inflicted on innocent, dumb,
living animals in the name of science, “falsely so called”.
There seem to be, however, signs of reaction setting in—the
almost phenomenal success of the Theosophical Society, the gradual
acceptance by the clergy of the doctrine of holiness, and what is more,
the acceptance by Professor Max Muller of the doctrine of reincarna-
tion  so conclusively demonstrated in The Perfect Way, his statement
that it was gaining ground among the thinking minds in England and
elsewhere, and the publication of The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ. It
is not possible to secure these works in S* Africa. My knowledge of
them is, therefore, confined to their reviews. All these and many such
facts are, I submit, unmistakable signs of a return from the materi-
alistic tendencies, which have made us so cruelly selfish, to the
unadulterated esoteric teachings of not only  Jesus Christ, but  also of
Buddha, Zoroaster and Mahomed, who are no longer so generally

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 205, 3, 4, 464911) SIR You will oblige me by letting me draw the attention of your rea- ders to the notice that appears in your advertisement columns about the Esoteric Christian Union and the London Vegetarian Society.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 205, 3, 5, 465112) The system represented by the Union establishes the unity and common source of all the great religions of the world, and points out, as the books advertised will amply show, the utter inadequacy of materialism which boasts of having given the world a civilization which was never witnessed before, and which is alleged to The Natal Advertiser have done the greatest good to humanity, all the while conveniently forgetting that its greatest achievenments are the invention of the most terrible weapons of destruction, the awful growth of anarchism, the frightful disputes between capital and labour and the wanton and diabolical cruelty inflicted on innocent, dumb, living animals in the name of science, “falsely so called”.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 205, 3, 6, 465837) There seem to be, however, signs of reaction setting in—the almost phenomenal success of the Theosophical Society, the gradual acceptance by the clergy of the doctrine of holiness, and what is more, the acceptance by Professor Max Muller of the doctrine of reincarna- tion so conclusively demonstrated in The Perfect Way, his statement that it was gaining ground among the thinking minds in England and elsewhere, and the publication of The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 205, 3, 7, 466308) It is not possible to secure these works in S. Africa.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 205, 3, 8, 466363) My knowledge of them is, therefore, confined to their reviews.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 205, 3, 9, 466426) All these and many such facts are, I submit, unmistakable signs of a return from the materi- alistic tendencies, which have made us so cruelly selfish, to the unadulterated esoteric teachings of not only Jesus Christ, but also of Buddha, Zoroaster and Mahomed, who are no longer so generally denounced by the civilized world as false prophets, but whose and Jesus's teachings are beginning to be acknowledged to be complemen- tary of one another.

New Para:  therefore, take some time before they arrive in Durban. I may,
however, state one valuable fact with regard to the efficacy of
vegetarianism. There is no more potent instrument of evil than
drunkenness, and I may be allowed to say that all those who suffer
from the craving for drink, but would like really to be free from the
curse, have only to give a trial for at least one month to a diet chiefly
consisting of brown bread and oranges or grapes, to secure an entire
freedom from the craving. I have myself carried on a series of
experiments, and can testify that on a vegetarian diet, without any
condiments, and consisting of a liberal supply of juicy fresh fruits, I
have lived comfortably, without tea, coffee, or cocoa, and even water,
for days together. Hundreds in England have become vegetarian for
this reason, and having once been inveterate tipplers, have now
reached a stage when the very smell of grog or whisky is an offence to
their tastes. Dr* B* W* Richardson, in his Food for Man, recommends
pure vegetarianism as a cure for drunkenness. In a comparatively hot
country like Natal, where there is a plentiful supply of fruits and
vegetables, a bloodless diet should prove very beneficial in every way,
apart from its immeasurable superiority to flesh foods on grounds
scientific, sanitary, economic, ethical and spiritual.
It is, perhaps, needless to mention that the sale of E.C.U* books
is not at all a money-making concern. In certain cases the books have
even been given away. They will be gladly lent in some cases. I shall
be very happy to correspond with any of your readers who may want
any  further information, either about the E.C.U* or the L.V.S*, or to
have a quiet chat on these (to me at any rate) momentous questions.

SIR
I trust, in the interests of justice, you will allow me to make a few
remarks on your report of the conversation that took place between
Sir Walter Wragg and Mr* Tatham with regard to a point of
Mahommedan Law, in your issue of the 22nd instant.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 208, 4, 6, 470964) DURBAN, March 23, 1895 TO THE EDITOR The Natal WitnesS SIR I trust, in the interests of justice, you will allow me to make a few remarks on your report of the conversation that took place between Sir Walter Wragg and Mr. Tatham with regard to a point of Mahommedan Law, in your issue of the 22nd instant.
New Para:  1 This was with reference to the following report in The Natal Witness,        
22-3-1895 :
Mr* Tatham applied to the Supreme Court yesterday for confirmation of the
Master's report in the intestate estate of Hassan Dawjee, and remarked that a plan of
distribution, prepared by Mr* Gandhi, barrister, had been embodied in the report, and
was framed according to Mahommedan Law.
SIR WALTHER WRAGG : The only thing about this is that Mr* Gandhi knows
nothing of Mahommedan Law. He is as great a stranger to Mahommedan Law as a
Frenchman. For what he has stated he would have to go to a book as you would; of his
own knowledge he knows nothing.
Mr Tatham said that a plan of distribution had been obtained from the priests
and from Mr* Gandhi. Where else they were to go he did not know. They had exhausted
all the expert evidence available.
SIR WALTHER WRAGG : The portion which Mr* Gandhi states should go to the
brother of the deceased, should, according to Mahommedan Law, go to the poor. Mr*
Gandhi is a Hindu and knows his own faith, of course, but he knows nothing of
Mahommedan Law.
MR* TATHAM : The question is whether we shall take Mr* Gandhi's view or the
priests'.
SIR WALTHER WRAGG : You must take the priests'. When the brother can show
that he represents the poor he will be entitled to 5/24ths, as stated by Mr* Gandhi.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 208, 5, 7, 471269) 1 This was with reference to the following report in The Natal Witness, 22-3-1895 : Mr. Tatham applied to the Supreme Court yesterday for confirmation of the Master's report in the intestate estate of Hassan Dawjee, and remarked that a plan of distribution, prepared by Mr. Gandhi, barrister, had been embodied in the report, and was framed according to Mahommedan Law.

New Para:  I have ventured to trespass upon your courtesy, not because I
want to defend myself, but because of the decision of the Supreme
Court, which, I believe, with all due respect to Sir Walter Wragg, is
based upon an erroneous view of the Mahommedan Law, and would
vitally affect a large portion of the Indian Colonists.
Were I a Mahommedan, I should be very sorry to be judged bya
Mahommedan whose sole qualification is that he is born a
Mahommedan. It is a revelation that the Mahommedans know the law
intuitively, and that a non-Mahommedan never dare give an opinion
on a point of Mahommedan Law.
The decision (if your report is correct) that the brother will be
entitled to his 5/24ths only after he “can show that he represents the
poor”, is, I am afraid, according to the Mahommedan Law
administered in India and revealed in the Koran, subversive of that
law. I have carefully gone through the chapters on “Inheritance” in
Macnaughten's Mahomedan Law (which, by the way, is edited by a
non-Mahommedan Indian and which Messrs Binns & Mason, in their
report published after their return from India, say is the book
considered to be one of the best on that law), and have also gone
through that portion of the Koran which relates to the subject, and in
them I find not one word with regard to the poor being entitled to any
part of the inheritance of a deceased Moslem. If the Koran and the
book above mentioned are any authority on that law, then not only is
there no portion to which the poor are entitled in the case in question,
but under no circumstances are the poor entitled to any part of an
intestate estate. I hope to be able to show that the brother (it should
really be the half-brother), when he takes anything under that law,
takes it in his own right, and takes it because he is a brother.
It is likely that His Lordship, when he was talking about an
inheritance, was actually but unconsciously thinking of almsgiving,
which is incumbent upon every Mahommedan. It is one of their
articles of faith. But the principle that guides almsgiving during life
does not obtain in cases of distribution of inheritance. A
Mahommedan, by giving alms during his lifetime, earns for himself
heaven or a respectable place therein. Alms given out of his estate by
the State  after his death can surely do him no spiritual good, because
it is not his act. After a Moslem's death it is the relatives who have a
prior, nay exclusive, claim upon his estate.
Says the Koran :

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 210, 7, 9, 475660) among his successors.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 210, 7, 10, 475682) The successors are thus described :

New Para:  contract; 5* acknowledged kindred; 6* universal legatee; 7* Crown.
“Legal sharers” are defined as “all those persons for whom
specific shares have been appointed or ordained in the sacred text, the
traditions, or with general assent”, and according to the table
enumerating the 12 classes of sharers, include half-brothers also.
“Residuaries” are “all persons for whom no share has been
appointed, and who take the residue after the sharers have been
satisfied, or the whole estate when there are no sharers”. It should
here be noted that some legal sharers are as such, under certain
conditions, excluded, and then rank as residuaries. “Distant kindred”
are “all relations who are neither sharers nor residuaries”. “After the
sharers are satisfied, if there remains a residue of the property left by
the deceased, it is to be divided among the first class of heirs called
residuaries. If there be no residuaries, the residue  will revert to the
sharers in proportion to their shares.”
I would not occupy your valuable space by giving definitions
of the other successors. Suffice it to say that they do not include the
poor at all, and that they can “take” only after the first three classes
are exhausted.
The residuaries in their own right include, among others, “the
'offspring' of the father of the deceased, i.e., brothers, consanguine
brothers, and their sons, how low soever”. Rule 12 of Section 1 says:
“It is a general rule that a brother shall take double the share of a
sister. The exception to it is in the case of brothers and sisters by the
same mother only, but by different fathers.” And Rule 25, Section 11,
says: “Where there are daughters or son's daughters and no brothers,

New Para:  the sisters take what remains after the daughters or son's daughters
have realized their shares, such residue being half should there be
only one daughter or son's daughter, and one third should there be
two or more.” The two rules read together help us materially to
determine the share the brother gets in the case in point.
In the typical examples given in the book I have been quoting
from, I find the following with its solution : “Example 7* Husband,
daughter, brother and three sisters.” The solution need not be given
fully. The brother as a residuary in his own right gets 2/20ths.
It will then be seen from the above that brothers, and in their
absence, half-brothers, rank either as sharers or residuaries in their
own right, and, therefore, with the greatest deference to Sir Walter's
opinion in the case in question, the brother “takes”, if he does at all,
in his own right and not as representing the poor, and if he does not
“take” (a thing that cannot happen in such a case if the law is to be
respected), the residue “reverts” to the sharers.
But the report says that the priest and I differ. If you eliminate
the “I” and put “the law” instead (for I simply said what the law
was), I would venture to say, the priest and the law should never differ,
and if they do, it is the priest and not the law that goes to the wall. In
this case, however, the priest and I do not differ if the distribution in
the report sent to me by Mr* Tatham was the one approved by the
priest, as it seems to have been, according to his letter of advice. The
priest says not a word about the half-brother taking as representing
the poor.
Lastly, after I saw the report, I saw purposely some
Mahommedan gentlemen who ought to know the law according to Sir
Walter, and they were surprised when I told them about the decision.
They, without even taking time to consider—the thing appeared to
them so plain and clear—said, “The poor never take anything from
an intestate estate. The half-brother as such should have his share.”
The decision then, I submit, is contrary to the Mahommedan
Law, the priest's opinion, and other Mahommedan gentlemen. It will
be a manifest hardship if the portions rightly belonging to the
relations of a deceased Mahommedan are to be locked up until they
can show that “they represent the poor”—a condition never
contemplated by the law or sanctioned by Mahommedan usage.

New Para:  HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT :
Your Petitioners, as representing the Indians in this Colony,
hereby respectfully approach your Honourable Assembly with regard
to the Indian Immigration Law Amendment Bill now before you for
consideration.
Your Petitioners respectfully submit that so much of the Bill
which provides for re-indenture and imposition of a tax in default of
re-indenture, is manifestly unjust, entirely uncalled for and in direct
opposition to the fundamental principles upon which the British
Constitution is based.
That the Bill is manifestly unjust, does not need, your Petitioners
submit, many words to prove. To raise the Maximum term of
indenture from five years to an indefinite period is in itself unjust,
because it puts in the way of the masters of the indentured Indians
greater temptations to oppression or harshness. No matter how
humane the masters may be in the Colony, they will always remain
human. And your Petitioners need hardly point out what human
nature is when selfish considerations guide one's actions. Moreover,
the Bill, your Petitioners venture to say, is an absolutely one-sided
arrangement, for, while it shows every cosideration to the employer, it
gives practically nothing in return to the employee.
The Bill is, your Petitioners submit, uncalled for because no
reasons exist for its introduction. It is not meant to help the Colony
out of a pecuniary crash or help forward any industry. On the other
hand, it was because it was recognized that the industries, for which the
Indian labour was specially required, no longer required any
extraordinary aid that the £10,000 vote was abolished only last year. it

during the last century in which Britain has played a prominent part.
Forced labour, from the grossest form of slavery to the mildest form
of veth
1, has always been repugnant to the British traditions, and has
everywhere, so far as practical, been abolished. Indentured labour
exists in Assam as it does in this Colony. It was only a short time ago
when it was admitted by her Majesty’s Government, in reference to
such labour in that country, that the indentured labour was an evil to
be countenanced only as long as it was absolutely necessary to
support or promote an important industry, and to be removed at the
first suitable opportunity. Your Petitioners respectfully submit that the
Bill under consideration violates the above principle.
If the proposed extension of the term of indenture is thus (your
Petitioners hope they have shown to your Honourable Assembly’s
satisfaction) unjust, uncalled for, and opposed to the fundamental
principles of the British Constitution, the proposed imposition of a tax
is more so. It has long been acknowledged as an axiomatic truth that
taxation is meant only for the purposes of revenue. It will not for a
moment be said, your Petitioners humbly think, that the proposed tax
is meant for any such purpose. The proposed taxation is avowedly
meant to drive the Indian out of the Colony after he has finished his
indenture. It will, therefore, be a prohibitive tax, and conflict with the
principles of Free Trade.
It will moreover inflict, your Petitioners fear, an unwarranted
wrong on the indentured Indians, because for an indentured Indian,
who has severed all connection with India and come down to the
Colony with his family, to go back and hope to earn a livelihood is
almost an utter impossibility. Your Petitioners crave leave to mention
from their own experience that, as a rule, it is only those Indians who
cannot find work to keep body and soul together in India who come
to the Colony under indenture. The very fabric of the Indian society
is such that the Indian, in the first place, does not leave his home, and
when once he is driven to do so, it is hopeless for him to return to
India and expect to earn bread, much less to make a fortune.

goods directly from England, Durban, Port Elizabeth, India, and other

are small vendors having stores in different places. There are nearly

that the moment the question of arbitration was broached, your
Petitioners protested both against the principle of arbitration and
against the choice of the Arbitrator. Your Petitioners conveyed the
protest verbally to His Honour the British Agent at Pretoria, who, your
Petitioners here take the opportunity to say, has always been most
courteous and attentive to those of your Petitioners who had occasion
to wait upon him from time to time in connection with the grievances
of the Indians in the Transvaal. Your Petitioners would also draw Your
Excellency’s attention to the fact that even a written protest was sent to
Her Majesty’s High Commissioner at Cape Town. However, your
Petitioners by dwelling upon the matter do not at all wish to cast the
slightest reflection on the high-mindedness or probity of the learned
Chief Justice of the Orange Free State or to question the wisdom of
Her Majesty’s officers. Having known the bias of the learned Chief
Justice against the Indians, your Petitioners thought, and still humbly
venture to think, that he could not, in spite of his most strenuous
efforts to do otherwise, bring to bear upon the question an
equibalanced judgment which is so necessary to a right and proper
perception of the facts of a case. Judges having a previous knowledge
of case have been known to refrain from deciding them, lest they
should unconsciously be led away by preconceived notions or
prejudices.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 218, 1, 3, 493268) 5. The Award as published in the papers is as follows:
New Para:  (a) The claims of Her Majesty’s Government and of the
Government of the South African Republic respectively are disallowed, save
and except to the extent and degree following, that is to say:

New Para:  (b) The South African Republic is bound and entitled in its
treatment of Indian and other Asiatic traders, being British subjects, to give
full force and effect to Law No. 3 of 1885, enacted, and in the year 1886
amended by the Volksraad of the South African Republic, subject (in case of
objection being raised by or on behalf of any such persons to any such
treatment as not being in accordance with the provisions of the said law as
amended) to sole and exclusive interpretation in the ordinary course by the
Tribunals of the country.
6* Now, your Petitioners humbly submit that the above Award
not being in terms of the reference is void, and that Her Majesty’s
Government is not, therefore, bound by it. The very object with which
the arbitration was decided upon is, it is respectfully pointed out,
frustrated. The reference leaves it to the Arbitrator either to allow the
claims of one of the two Governments or to lay down such
interpretation of the Ordinances as may appear to him to be correct,
regard being had to the Despatches referring to the question. Instead
of interpreting, the learned Arbitrator has delegated the interpretation,
and in delegating has, moreover, limited the delegation to such
persons as, by the very nature of their position, cannot possibly avail
themselves of the procedure and evidence that could be availed of,
nay that was expressly stipulated to be availed of, by the Arbitrator,
and that would tend to enable them to lay down such an interpretation
as would be just and equitable, though, perhaps, not strictly legal.
7* The Award, your Petitioners submit, is invalid on two
grounds. First, because the Arbitrator had delegated his function,
which no arbitrator in the world can do. Secondly, the Arbitrator has
failed to keep to the reference, inasmuch as he has left undecided the
question that he was expressly called upon to decide.

of homes and may leave them penniless, will not be left to be decided
merely in a court of law where everybody’s hands are tied down, and
where such considerations find no place. So far as the traders are
concerned, if the contention of the Transvaal Government is
ultimately upheld, it means absolute ruin to them, and not only to
them personally, but to their families and relations and servants, both
in India and the Transvaal, who are dependent upon them. It is
impossible for some of your Petitioners, who have been trading for a
long time in the Transvaal, to seek “pastures new” and manage to

Majesty’s Government throughout the correspondence about the Law
3 of 1885 that separate streets might be set apart for the Indians in the
interests of pubic health, but that they cannot be compelled to trade in
certain fixed parts only of the towns. After the Law 3 of 1885 was

says in his letter (26th September, 1886, page 46, Green Book No. 1,
1894) : “Although the amended law is still a contravention of the
14th Article of the Convention of London
1 I shall not advise Her
Majesty’s Government to offer further opposition to it in view of
Your Honour’s opinion that it is necessary for the protection of the
public health.” Even the reference to the Arbitrator and the Law 3 of
1885 shows clearly that the departure from the Convention was to be
assented to only for sanitary reasons.
12* Your Petitioners hereby enter their most respectful, but
emphatic protest against the assumption that there exist sanitary
reasons for such a departure; your Petitioners hope to be able to show
that no such reasons exist.
13* Your Petitioners append hereto three certificates from
doctors which would speak for themselves and which show that their
dwellings are in no way inferior to those of the Europeans, from a
sanitary point of view (App. A,B,C). Your Petitioners challenge
comparison of their own dwellings with those of the Europeans who
have theirs in their immediate neighbourhood. For, it so happens in
Pretoria that, side by side with some of your Petitioners’ houses and
stores, are situated also the houses and stores of Europeans.

On the 16th October, 1885, Mr* Mitchell, the then Joint General
Manager of the Standard Bank, writes thus to the High Commissioner,

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 220, 1, 3, 498215) It has been emphatically laid down by Her Majesty’s Government throughout the correspondence about the Law 3 of 1885 that separate streets might be set apart for the Indians in the interests of pubic health, but that they cannot be compelled to trade in certain fixed parts only of the towns.

bathe much oftener than the Europeans residing in the Transvaal

New Para:  As these men enter the State without wives or female relatives the result
is obvious. Their religion teaches them to consider all women as soulless and
Christians as natural prey (Green Book No. 1, 1894, p. 30).
21* Your Petitioners ask, can there be a grosser libel on the great
faiths prevailing in India or a greater insult to the Indian nation?
22* Such are the statements which, it will be noticed from  the
Green Books referred to, have been used to make out a case against
the Indians.
23* The real and the only reason has all along been suppressed.
The only reason for compelling your Petitioners [to live in Location]
or putting every obstacle in the way of your Petitioners earning a
decent livelihood is the trade jealousy. Your Petitioners, i.e., those who
are traders—and the whole crusade is practically against them—have,
by their competition and owing to their temperate and thrifty habits,
been able to reduce the prices of the necessaries of life. This does not
suit the European traders who would make very large profits. It is a
notorious fact that your Petitioners, who are traders, are almost without
exception teetotallers. Their habits are simple, and thus they are
content to make small profits. This and this only is the reason of the
opposition against them, and this is well-known to everybody in South
Africa. That this is so can be gathered from the public Press of South
Africa, which sometimes becomes frank and shows the hatred in its
true light. Thus, dealing with the “Coolie question”, as it is
contemptuously called, after showing that the real “Coolie” is
indispensable to South Africa, The Natal Advertiser of the 15th

equally harmless Indian, who carries his pack of dainty wares from house to

New Para:  It is about time that those who cry out against the Indian merchant
should have pointed out to them, who and what he is. Many of his worst
detractors are British subjects enjoying all the privileges and rights of
membership in a glorious community. To them the hatred of injustice, and the
love of fair play is inherent, and when it affects themselves, they have a
method of insisting upon their rights and liberties, whether under a foreign
government or under their own. Possibly, it has never struck them that the
Indian merchant is also a British subject, and claims the same liberties and
rights with equal justice. To say the very least of it, if we may be permitted to
employ a phrase of Palmerston’s days, it is very un-English to claim rights
one would not allow to others. The right of trade as an equal privilege has,
since the abolition of the Elizabethan monopolies, become almost a part of
the English Constitution, and were anyone to interfere with that right, the
privilege of British citizenship would suddenly come to the front. That the
Indian is more successful in competition and lives on less than the English
merchant is the unfairest and weakest of arguments. The very foundation of
English Commerce lies in the fact of our being able to compete more
successfully with other nations. Surely, it is protection running to madness

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 224, 2, 10, 509810) To them the hatred of injustice, and the love of fair play is inherent, and when it affects themselves, they have a method of insisting upon their rights and liberties, whether under a foreign government or under their own.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 224, 2, 11, 510034) Possibly, it has never struck them that the Indian merchant is also a British subject, and claims the same liberties and rights with equal justice.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 224, 2, 12, 510182) To say the very least of it, if we may be permitted to employ a phrase of Palmerston’s days, it is very un-English to claim rights one would not allow to others.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 224, 2, 13, 510344) The right of trade as an equal privilege has, since the abolition of the Elizabethan monopolies, become almost a part of the English Constitution, and were anyone to interfere with that right, the privilege of British citizenship would suddenly come to the front.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 224, 2, 14, 510608) That the Indian is more successful in competition and lives on less than the English merchant is the unfairest and weakest of arguments.

glaring that one is almost ashamed of one’s countrymen in wishing to have
these men treated as Natives, simply because of their success in trade. The very
reason that they have been so successful against the dominant race is
sufficient to raise them above that degrading level. . . . Enough has been said
to show that the Indian merchant is something more than the ‘Coolie’ of the
newspaper, the Dutchman and the disappointed shopkeeper.
28* It will also be seen from the above quotation that the
European feeling, when not blinded by selfishness, is not against the
Indians. But since it has been insisted throughout the Green books,
before alluded to, that both the Burghers of the State and the
European residents objected to the Indians, your Petitioners are
sending two petitions to His Honour the State President of the S.A*
Republic, one showing that a very large number of the Burghers are
not only not against the Indians freely residing and trading in the
Transvaal, but they would also deem it a hardship, should the
harassing measures ultimately result in their withdrawal (App. E); and
the other signed by the European residents, showing that, in the
opinion of the signatories, their sanitary habits are in no way inferior
to those of the Europeans, and that the agitation against the Indians is
due to the trade jealousy (App. F). But were it otherwise—were every
European and every Burgher of the State dead against the Indian—
even that, your Petitioners submit, cannot affect the main issue, unless
the causes which render such a state of things possible were such as
would discredit a community against whom such a feeling exists. At
the time of going to press (14-5-95), the Dutch petition was already
signed by 484 Burghers and the European by 1340 Europeans.

New Para:  are gladly received by the Europeans there. They are not required to
have passes. Why, your Petitioners humbly ask, should they be
differently treated in the Transvaal? Do their sanitary habits become
filthy as soon as they enter the Transvaal territory? It often happens
that the same Indian is differently treated by the same European in
Delagoa Bay and the Transvaal.
34* To show how harassing the pass law is, your Petitioners have
appended hereto an affidavit from Mr* Haji Mahomed Haji Dada,
which will speak for itself (App. G). Who Mr* Haji Mahomed is, willbe
gathered from the copy of a letter attached to the affidavit (App. H).
He is one of the foremost Indians in South Africa. Your Petitioners
have attached the affidavit by way of illustration only, and to show
how hard must be the lot of the other Indians, when a foremost
Indian cannot travel without suffering indignity and actual hardships.
If it were necessary, hundreds of such cases of ill-treatment could be
proved to the hilt.
35* It has been also mentioned that the Indians live as parasites,
and spend nothing. So far as the Indian labourers and their children
are concerned, the objection will not hold water at all, and they are not
supposed to be parasites, even by the most prejudiced Europeans.
Your Petitioners may be allowed to mention from personal experience
that, so far as a majority of the labourers are concerned, they live
above their means and have settled with their families. As to the
trading Indians, who are the butt of all the prejudice, a little
explanation may be necessary. Your Petitioners, who are traders, do
not deny, they take pride in acknowledging, that they send remittances
to India for those who are dependent upon them, but the remittances
are entirely out of proportion to their expenditure. The only reason
why they are successful competitors is because they spend less on
luxuries than the European traders. But, all the same, they have to pay
rents to the European landlords, wages to the Native servants, and to
pay Dutch farmers for the animals for meat. The other provisions,
such as tea, coffee, etc., are bought in the country.
36* The question, then, really is not whether the Indian is to live
in this street or that, but what status he is to occupy throughout South
Africa. For, what is done in the Transvaal will also affect the action of
the two Colonies. There seems to be a general consensus of opinion
that the question will have to be settled on a common basis, modified
by local conditions.

hence, between the progeny of the Indians thus in course of
degeneration and the Natives, there will be very little difference in
habits, and customs, and thought. The very object of immigration will
be frustrated, and a large portion of Her Majesty's subjects, instead of
being raised in the scale of civilization, will be actually lowered. The
results of such a state of things cannot but be disastrous. No self-
respecting Indian can dare even visit South Africa. All Indian
enterprise will be stifled. Your Petitioners have no doubt that Your
Excellency will never allow such a sad event to happen in a place
where Her Majesty enjoys suzerain power, or where the Union Jack
flies.

the Convention is finally assented to, some impartial inquiry should be
made as to the truth of the conflicting statements, and that the whole
question of the status of the Indian in South Africa should be sifted.
In conclusion, your Petitioners leave their case in Your
Excellency's hands, earnestly praying and fully hoping that your
Petitioners will not be allowed to become a prey to the colour
prejudice, and that Her Majesty's Government will not consent to a
treatment of the Indians in the South African Republic which would
place them in a degraded and unnatural position and deprive them of

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 229, 1, 2, 521306) be degraded to the habits of the aboriginal Natives, and a generation hence, between the progeny of the Indians thus in course of degeneration and the Natives, there will be very little difference in habits, and customs, and thought.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 229, 1, 3, 521540) The very object of immigration will be frustrated, and a large portion of Her Majesty's subjects, instead of being raised in the scale of civilization, will be actually lowered.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 229, 1, 4, 521718) The results of such a state of things cannot but be disastrous.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 229, 1, 5, 521782) No self- respecting Indian can dare even visit South Africa.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 229, 1, 6, 521843) All Indian enterprise will be stifled.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 229, 1, 7, 521882) Your Petitioners have no doubt that Your Excellency will never allow such a sad event to happen in a place where Her Majesty enjoys suzerain power, or where the Union Jack flies.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 229, 1, 8, 522061) 42. Your Petitioners beg respectfully to point out that, under the present state of feeling against the Indians in South Africa, for Her Majesty's Government to yield to the interested clamour against your Petitioners would be an act of grave injustice to your Petitioners.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 229, 1, 9, 522335) 43. If it is true that your Petitioners' sanitary habits are not such as to endanger the health of the European community, and if it be true also that the agitation against them is due to trade jealousy, your Petitioners submit that the Award of the Chief Justice of the Orange Free State cannot be binding, even though it be in strict accordance with the terms of the reference.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 229, 1, 10, 522715) For, the very reason which induced Her Majesty's Government to assent to a departure from the Convention does not then exist.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 229, 1, 11, 522841) 44. If, however, Your Excellency is disposed to doubt the statements made herein, as regards your Petitioners' sanitary habits, your Petitioners humbly urge that, in view of the fact that very large interests are at stake, and that there are conflicting statements with regard to your Petitioners' sanitary habits, and that the feeling is very high against the Indians in South Africa, before any departure from the Convention is finally assented to, some impartial inquiry should be made as to the truth of the conflicting statements, and that the whole question of the status of the Indian in South Africa should be sifted.

New Para:  I have generally found them cleanly in their person, and free from the personal
diseases due to dirt or careless habits. Their dwellings are generally clean and
sanitation is willingly attended to by them. Class considered, I should be of opinion
that the lowest class Indian compares most favourably with the lowest class white,
i.e. the lowest class Indian lives better and in better habitation, and with more regard
to sanitary measures, than the lowest class white.

nearly had one or more of its members at some time in the lazaretto, there was not a
single Indian attacked.

we, the undersigned burghers, beg respectfully to state that so far from the burghers

New Para:  So far as our experience is concerned, we believe their sanitary habits to be in
no way inferior to those of the Europeans, and the statements about prevalence of
infectious diseases among them are certainly without ground, especially as regards
the Indian traders.

New Para:  We firmly believe that the agitation owes its origin not to their habits as
regards sanitation, but to trade jealousy, because, owing to their frugal and temperate
habits, they have been able to keep down the prices of necessaries of life and have
therefore been an inestimable boon to the poor classes of the society in the State.

in separate quarters.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 233, 6, 7, 530309) We do not believe any good cause exists for compelling them to reside or trade in separate quarters.

any measure that would tend to restrict their freedom and ultimately result in their
withdrawal from the Republic, a result that cannot but strike at the very means of their
livelihood and cannot, therefore, we humbly submit, be contemplated with
complacency in a Christian country.

Republic.
Your Petitioners instead of reiterating the facts and arguments

conclusion that unless they sought the direct protection of Your
Excellency as Her Majesty's representative and virtual Ruler of all
India, and unless that protection was graciously accorded, the position
of the Indians in the South African Republic, and indeed throughout
the whole of South Africa, would be utterly helpless and the
enterprising Indians in South Africa would be forcibly degraded to
the position of the Natives of South Africa, and this through no fault
of their own.

trade, who could not get licences to trade, and who would shortly be
ordered to remove to places far away from towns, where only they
could reside and trade, and who could not stir out of their houses after
9 o'clock, and that stranger were asked to guess the reasons for such
special disabilities, would he not conclude that these people must be
veritable ruffians, anarchists, a political danger to the State and
society? And yet your Petitioners beg to assure Your Excellency that
the Indians who are labouring under all the above disabilities are
neither ruffians nor anarchists, but one of the most peaceful and law-
abiding communities in South Africa, and especially in the South
African Republic.
For in Johannesburg, while there are people belonging to
European nationalities who are a source of real danger to the State,
and who have necessitated only lately an increase of the police force,
and have thrown too much work on the detective department, the
Indian community have not given the State any cause for anxiety on
that score.
In support of the above, your Petitioners respectfully refer Your
Excellency to the newspapers throughout South Africa.
Even the active agitation, that has brought about the present state
of things with regard to the Indian community, has not desired to
bring any such charges against the Indians.
The only charge brought forward is that the Indians do not
observe proper sanitation. Your Petitioners trust that the charge has
been conclusively shown to be groundless in the representation to His
Excellency the Right Honourable the Marquis of Ripon. But assuming
that the charge has some ground, it is clear that that could not be a
reason for preventing the Indians from holding fixed property, or
moving about the country freely and without restraint on their liberty.
That could not be a reason for making the Indians liable for a special
payment of £3 10s.
It might be said that the Government of the South African
Republic has already passed certain laws, and that the Chief Justice of
the Orange Free State has already given his Award which is binding
on Her Majesty's Government.
These objections, your Petitioners humbly believe, have been
answered in the accompanying petition. The London Convention
specially protects the rights of all Her Majesty's British subjects. This

departure from the Convention and also to arbitration on sanitary
grounds. And such assent to a departure from the Convention, your
Petitioners are informed, was given without consulting Your
Excellency's predecessor in office. Thus, so far as the Indian
Government is concerned, your Petitioners venture to urge that the
assent is not binding. That the Indian Government should  have been
consulted is self-evident. And even if Your Excellency were ill-
disposed to intervene on your Petitioners' behalf at this stage and on
this ground alone, the fact that the reasons which induced the above
assent did not and do not exist, that in fact Her Majesty's Government
has been misled by misrepresentations is, your Petitioners submit,
sufficient to justify them in praying for Your Excellency's
intervention, and Your Excellency in granting the prayer.
And the issues involved are so tremendously important and
Imperial, that in view of your Petitioners' emphatic but respectful
protest against the allegation about sanitation, your Petitioners humbly
urge that the question cannot be settled without a thorough inquiry,
without injustice being done to Her Majesty's Indian British subjects in
the South African Republic.
Without further encroaching upon Your Excellency's valuable
time, your Petitioners would again request Your Excellency's
undivided attention to the annexure and, in conclusion, earnestly hope

New Para:  It was in England that I read in Mrs* Anna Kingsford's Perfect
Way in Diet that there was a colony of Trappists
2 in South Africa who
were vegetarians. Ever since that I had wished to see these vegetarians.
The wish has at last been realized.
At the outset, I may remark that South Africa, and particularly
Natal, is especially adapted for vegetarians. The Indians have made
Natal the Garden Colony of South Africa. One can grow almost
anything on the South African soil, and that in abundance. The
supply of bananas, pineapples and oranges is almost inexhaustible,
and far greater than the demand. There is no wonder that the
vegetarians can thrive very well in Natal. The only wonder is, that in
spite of such facilities and the warm climate, there should be so few
vegetarians. The result is that large tracts of land still remain neglected
and uncultivated. The staple articles of food are imported when it is
perfectly possible to grow all of them in South Africa; and in a vast
territory like Natal, there is much distress among a small population of
40,000 whites. All this, because they will not take to agricultural
pursuits.
Another curious but painful result of the unnatural mode of
living is that there is a very strong prejudice against the Indian
population who also number 40,000* The Indians, being vegetarians,
take to agriculture without any difficulty whatsoever. Naturally,

New Para:  therefore, all over the Colony, the small farms are owned by Indians,
whose keen competition gives offence to the white population. They
are following a dog-in-the-manager and suicidal policy in so
behaving. They would rather leave the vast agricultural resources in
the country undeveloped, than have the Indians to develop them.
Owing to such stolidity and shortsightedness, a Colony that can easily
support double, or even treble, the number of European and Indian
inhabitants, with difficulty supports 80,000 Europeans and Indians.
The Transvaal Government have gone so far in their prejudice, that
the whole of the Republic, although the soil is very fruitful, remains a
desert of dust. And if the gold mines could not be worked from any
cause, thousands of men would be thrown out of employment and
literally starved to death. Is there not here a great lesson to be learnt?
The flesheating habits have really tended to retard the progress of the
community, and, indirectly, to create division among the two great
communities which ought to be united and work hand in hand. There
is also this striking fact to be noticed that the Indians enjoy as good a
health as the Europeans in the Colony, and I know that many doctors
would be simply starving if there were no Europeans, or their flesh-
pots, and that by their thrifty and temperate habits, both attributable to
vegetarianism, Indians can successfully compete with Europeans. Of
course, it should be understood that the Indians in the Colony are not
pure vegetarians. They are practically so.
We shall see presently how the Trappists of Mariann Hill, near
Pinetown, are a standing testimony to the truth of the above remarks.
Pinetown is a little village, situated at a distance of 16 miles by
rail from Durban. It is about 1,100 feet above the sea leavel, and
enjoys a beautiful climate.
The Trappist monastery is about three miles distant from
Pinetown. My companion and I walked to Mariann Hill, as the hill, or
rather the cluster of hills, on which the Abbey is situated, is called. It is
a very pleasant walk through the little hills all covered with green
grass.
On our reaching the settlement, we saw a gentleman with a pipe
in his mouth, and we at once knew that he was not one of the
brotherhood. He, however, took us to the visitors' room, where a
visitors' book was kept. It appeared from the book that it commenced
from 1894, and there were hardly twenty pages filled up. Indeed, the
mission is not at all known as it ought to be.

New Para:  One of the brotherhood came up and bowed very low. We were
offered tamarind water and pineapples. After having refreshed
ourselves, we accompanied the guide to the various places he took us
to. The various buildings one saw were all substantial red-brick
buildings. All was quiet; the silence was broken only by the noise of
the instruments in the workshops or the native children.
The settlement is a quiet little model village, owned on the truest
republican principles. The principle of liberty, equality and fraternity
is carried out in its entirety. Every man is a brother, every woman a
sister. The monks number about 120 on the settlement, and the nuns,
or the sisters as they are called, number about 60* The sisters' cloister
is about half a mile from the brothers'. Both the brothers and the
sisters observe a strict vow of silence and of chastity. No brother or
sister may speak except those who are allowed to by the Abbot, who is
the head of the Trappists in Natal. And those are only allowed to
speak who have to go to town to make purchases or to look after
visitors.
The brothers are dressed in long robes with a black piece of
cloth in front and on the back. The sisters wear red clothing of the
simplest style. None seemed to wear socks.
A candidate for the brotherhood has to make a vow for two
years and, till then, is called a novice. After two years, he may either
leave the cloister or make a vow for life. A model Trappist gets up at 2
a.m. and devotes four hours to prayer and contemplation. At six, he
has his breakfast, which consists of bread and coffee, or some such
simple foods. He dines at twelve, and makes a meal of bread and soup,
and fruits. He sups at six in the evening and goes to bed at 7 or 8 p.m.
The brothers eat no fish, flesh or fowl. They discard even eggs. They
take milk, but in Natal we were told they could not get it cheap. The
sisters are allowed meat four days in the week. Asked why they put up
with such an anomaly, the obliging guide said: “Because the sisters
are more delicate than the brothers.” Neither my companion, who is
almost a vegetarian, nor I could see the force or logic of the
reasoning. Certainly, both of us were very much grieved to hear the
news which was a surprise to us, for we expected both the brothers and
the sister to be vegetarians.
They take no intoxicating liquors except under medical advice.
None may keep money for private use. All are equally rich or poor.

not leave the limits of the settlement, except those who are permitted
to do so on business. They may not read newspapers and books that
are not religious. They may not read any religious books but only
those that are allowed. It is this hard austere life that caused our friend
with the pipe in his mouth, whom we first met, to remark in reply to a
question whether he was a Trappist—”No fear, I am anything but a
Trappist.” And yet the good brothers and sisters did not seem to
consider their lives to have fallen on hard places.
A Protestant clergyman said to his audience that the Roman
Catholics are weakly, sickly and sad. Well, if the Trappists are any
criterion of what a Catholic is, they are, on the contrary, healthy and
cheerful. Wherever we went, a beaming smile and a lowly bow greeted
us, whether we saw a brother or a sister. Even while the guide was
descanting on the system he prized so much, he did not at all seem to
consider the self-chosen discipline a hard yoke to bear. A better
instance of undying faith and perfect, implicit obedience could not
well be found anywhere else.
If their repast is the simplest possible, their dining tables and
bedrooms are no less so.
The former are made on the settlement, of wood, without any
varnish. They use no tablecloths. The knives and spoons are the
cheapest to be had in Durban. Instead of glass-ware they use
enamelled things.
For bedrooms they have a large hall (but none too large for the
inmates) which contains about 80 beds. Every available space is
utilized for the beds.
In the Native quarters they seem to have overdone it in point of
beds. As soon as we entered the sleeping hall for Natives, we noticed
the closeness and the stuffy air. The beds are all joined together, sepa-
rated by only single boards. There was hardly space enough to walk.
They believe in no colour distinctions. The Natives are accorded
the same treatment as the whites. They are mostly children. They get
the same food as the brothers, and are dressed as well as they
themselves are. While it is generally said, not without some truth, that
the Christian Kaffir is a failure, everyone, even the wildest sceptic,
admit that the mission of the Trappists has proved the most successful

New Para:  to contract all the terrible vices of the Western civilization, and very
rarely produce any moral effect on them, the Natives of the Trappist
mission are patterns of simplicity, virtue and gentleness. It was a treat
to see them saluting passers-by in a humble yet dignified manner.
There are about 1,200 Natives on the mission, including
children and adults. They have all exchanged a life of sloth, indolence
and superstition, for one of industry, usefulness and devotion to one
Supreme God.
On the settlement there are various workshops—blacksmiths’,
tinsmith0s’, carpenters’, shoemakers’, tanners’, etc., where the Natives
are taught all these useful industries, in addition to the English and the
Zulu languages. Here it may be remarked that it speaks volumes for
the highmindedness of the noble settlers that, although almost all of
them are Germans, they never attempt to teach the Natives German; all
these Natives work side by side with the whites.
At the sisters’ cloisters, they have the ironing, sewing, strawhat
manufacturing and knitting departments, where one can see the Native
girls, dressed in clean costumes, working assiduously.
About two miles from the Abbey is situated the printing
department, and the flour mill worked by a waterfall. It is a huge pile
of building. There is also an oil machine, which is worked for pressing
the oil from monkey nuts. It is needless to mention that the above
mentioned workshops supply the settlers with most of their
requirements.
They grow many kinds of tropical fruits on the farm and the
settlement is almost self-supporting.
They love and respect, and are in turn loved and respected by,
the Natives living in their neighbourhood who, as a rule, supply them
with the converts.
The most prominent feature of the settlement is that you see
religion everywhere. Every room has a Cross and, on the entrance, a
small receptacle for holy water which every inmate reverently applies
to his eyelids, the forehead and the chest. Even the quick walk to the
flour mill is not without some reminder of the Cross. It is a lovely
footpath. On one side, you have a magnificent valley through which
runs a small rivulet which murmurs the sweetest music, and on the
other, little rocks whereon are carved the various inscriptions
reminding you of the scenes of the Calvary. The valley is wholly
covered with a green carpet of vegetation, studded with beautiful trees

imagined. The inscriptions carved in such a place cannot fail to
produce a grand effect upon the mind. They are carved at such
regular intervals that no sooner has one completed one’s thoughts on
one inscription than another meets one’s gaze.
The walk thus forms a continuous exercise for calm
contemplation, unmarred by any other thoughts, or outside noise and
bustle. Some of the inscriptions are: “Jesus falls a first time”; “Jesus
falls a second time”; “Simon carries the Cross”; “Jesus is nailed to
the Cross”; “Jesus is laid in his mother’s lap”, etc., etc..
Of course, the Natives, too, are chiefly vegetarians. Although
they are not prohibited from taking flesh or meat, they are not
supplied with any on the settlement.
There are about twelve such settlements in South Africa, most of
which are in Natal. There are in all about 300 monks and about 120
nuns.
Such are our vegetarians in Natal. Though they do not make of
vegetarianism a creed, though they base it simply on the ground that a
vegetarian diet helps them to crucify the flesh better, and though,
perhaps, they are not even aware of the existence of the vegetarian
societies, and would not even care to read any vegetarian literature,
where is the vegetarian who would not be proud of this noble band,
even a casul intercourse with whom fills one with a spirit of love,
charity and self-sacrifice, and who are a living testimony to the
triumph of vegetarianism from a spiritual point of view? I know from
personal experience that a visit to the farm is worth a voyage from
London to Natal. It cannot but produce a lasting holy impression on
the mind. No matter whether one is a Protestant, a Christian or a
Buddhist or what not, one cannot help exclaiming, after a visit to the
farm: “If this is Roman Catholicism, everything  said against it is a
lie.”  It proves  conclusively,  to my mind,  that a religion appears
divine or devilish, according as its professors choose to make it
appear.

The report states that the Indians were observed “with portions
of sleepers on their heads”.
2 The evidence was that. . . seven charged
had on their heads portions of sleepers together with. . .
3 Although the
sleepers were called for they were never produced. The report says,
“On attempting to arrest them 71 of their number turned round with
sticks, tins, pieces of iron and cooking utensils and plied them freely
on the police making them fly for safety. P* C* Madden arrived on the
scene with further assistance.” The evidence went to show that the
seven charged turned round with sticks, and two of them incited to
oppose. There was only one policeman at first and that was the Native
constable. Then P* C* Madden alone, not with any assistance, came on
the scene. While the Native constable is alleged to have been resisted,
P* C* Madden distinctly said he was not resisted at all. The report goes
on: “The rest followed by a body. . . saying they would not leave
until their colleagues were discharged.” The uncontradicted evidence
of Mr* Mason, who knew what he was talking about, went to show that
“the rest” were under arrest and were, Mr* Mason was informed by
Mr* Madden, going to be charged by the Railway Department with
desertion. They have gone now for the second time to Mr* Mason to
complain that they were starving. The report says, “Three or four
constables appeared in the court with their faces bruised and their
clothes torn.” The facts are that there was only the Native constable
who said he was beaten with sticks. When asked if he could show any
marks, he said it was”somewhere” on his head that no one could see.
He had no bruises. His clothes were neither torn, nor did he complain
that they were. So far as my memory can be trusted, I believe there
was not a single word about “utensils and irons”. And if all had
bundles of sticks on their heads it is not easy to understand how they

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 246, 1, 3, 558978) Your Petitioners humbly draw the attention of this Honourable House to the following from the report of the delegates, Messrs Binns 1
New Para:  and Mason, who were commissioned to go to India in connection with
this matter:
 So far no second term of indenture has been agreed to in the case
of any country to which Coolies emigrated, although the consent of the
Government of India had frequently been asked for; and in no instance had
the condition of compulsory return at the end of the indentures been
sanctioned.
Thus the clauses in the Bill are a total departure, your
Petitioners submit, for the worse, from the practice prevalent
throughout the British Colonies.
Assuming that the average age of an indentured Indian at the
time of his entering into the contract of indenture is 25, under the
clause which expects the Indian to work for 10 years, the best part of
the life of the indentured Indian would be simply spent away in a state
of bondage.
For an Indian to return to India after continuous 10 years’
stay in the Colony would be pure fatuity. All the old cords and ties
will have been broken up. Such an Indian will be comparatively a
stranger in his motherland. To find work in India would be almost
impossible. The market is already overcrowded, and he will not have
amassed sufficient fortune to enable him to live on the interest on his
capital.
The total of the wages for 10 years would amount to £87* If
the indentured Indian saves £50, allowing only £37 for clothing and
other expenses during the whole 10 years, that capital will not give
him interest sufficient to keep body and soul together, even in a poor
country like India. Such an Indian, therefore, even if he ventured to
return to India, would be compelled to return under indenture, and
thus his whole life would be spent in bondage. Moreover, during the
10 years the indentured Indian would be entirely neglecting his
family, should he have any. And a family man will not be able to save
even £50* Your Petitioners know several instances of indentured
Indians with families having saved nothing.

Why one class of Her Majesty’s subjects, and this the most useful to
the Colony, should be singled out for such taxation, it is, in the
humble opinion of your Petitioners, difficult to understand.
Your Petitioners most respectfully venture to submit that it is not
in accordance with the principles of simple justice and equity to make
a man pay heavily for being allowed to remain free in the Colony
after he has already lived under bondage for 10 years.
The fact that the clauses will apply only to those Indians who
would come to the Colony after the Bill has become law, and that they
would know the terms under which they may come, does not free the
clauses from the objections sought to be raised against them. For both
the contracting parties, your Petitioners submit, will not have the same
freedom of action. An Indian hard-pressed by pangs of poverty and
finding it impossible to support his family can scarcely be called a
free agent when he signs the contract of indenture. Men have been
known to consent to do far worse things in order to be free from
immediately pressing difficulties. Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly
hope and pray that the clauses above referred to will not meet with the
approval of this Honourable House, and for this act of justice and

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 247, 1, 3, 561271) Why one class of Her Majesty’s subjects, and this the most useful to the Colony, should be singled out for such taxation, it is, in the humble opinion of your Petitioners, difficult to understand.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 247, 1, 4, 561468) Your Petitioners most respectfully venture to submit that it is not in accordance with the principles of simple justice and equity to make a man pay heavily for being allowed to remain free in the Colony after he has already lived under bondage for 10 years.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 247, 1, 5, 561727) The fact that the clauses will apply only to those Indians who would come to the Colony after the Bill has become law, and that they would know the terms under which they may come, does not free the clauses from the objections sought to be raised against them.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 247, 1, 6, 561988) For both the contracting parties, your Petitioners submit, will not have the same freedom of action.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 247, 1, 7, 562089) An Indian hard-pressed by pangs of poverty and finding it impossible to support his family can scarcely be called a free agent when he signs the contract of indenture.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 247, 1, 8, 562257) Men have been known to consent to do far worse things in order to be free from immediately pressing difficulties.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 247, 1, 9, 562371) Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly hope and pray that the clauses above referred to will not meet with the approval of this Honourable House, and for this act of justice and mercy, your Petitioners shall for ever pray, etc., etc.

Law, shall contain a Covenant by the Indian immigrants, in words as follows:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 249, 1, 2, 564776) C of the Indian Immigration Law, 1891, referred to in Section 11 of the said Law, shall contain a Covenant by the Indian immigrants, in words as follows:
New Para:  And we further agree that after the expiration or other determination we
shall either return to India or remain in Natal under indentures to be from time
to time entered into; provided that each term of new indentured service shall be
for two years, and provided further, that the rate of wages for each year of
indentured service after that provided by this Contract shall be 16/- per month
for the first year, 17/- per month for the second year, 18/- per month forthe
third year, 19/- per month for the fourth year, and 20/- per month for the fifth
and each succeeding year.
Clause 6 runs as follows:
Every indentured Indian who shall have entered into the
Covenant set out in Section 2 of this Act, and who shall fail, neglect, or
refuse to return to India, or become re-indentured in Natal, shall take
out year by year, a pass or licence to remain in the Colony to be
issued by the Magistrate of his district, and shall pay for such pass or
licence a yearly sum of £3 sterling, which may be recovered by
summary process by any Clerk of the Peace or other officer
appointed to get in such licence money.
The Schedule B referred to in Clause 2, quoted above, so far as
it relates to the period of service is as follows:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 249, 2, 3, 564930) And we further agree that after the expiration or other determination we shall either return to India or remain in Natal under indentures to be from time to time entered into; provided that each term of new indentured service shall be for two years, and provided further, that the rate of wages for each year of indentured service after that provided by this Contract shall be 16/- per month for the first year, 17/- per month for the second year, 18/- per month forthe third year, 19/- per month for the fourth year, and 20/- per month for the fifth and each succeeding year.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 249, 2, 4, 565507) Clause 6 runs as follows: Every indentured Indian who shall have entered into the Covenant set out in Section 2 of this Act, and who shall fail, neglect, or refuse to return to India, or become re-indentured in Natal, shall take out year by year, a pass or licence to remain in the Colony to be issued by the Magistrate of his district, and shall pay for such pass or licence a yearly sum of £3 sterling, which may be recovered by summary process by any Clerk of the Peace or other officer appointed to get in such licence money.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 249, 2, 5, 566037) The Schedule B referred to in Clause 2, quoted above, so far as it relates to the period of service is as follows:
New Para:  We, the undersigned, emigrants from . . . . to Natal, hereby engage
to serve the employer to whom we may respectively be allotted by the
Protector of Indian Immigrants to Natal; provided that we shall receive
monthly in money the wages stated hereunder opposite our respective
names, and the allowances following.
4* From the above it will be seen, that if the Bill under discussion
became law, an indentured Indian, in case he desires to settle in the
Colony after the first five years of his indentured service, should either
have to remain under perpetual indenture, or pay a yearly tax of £3;
your Memorialists have used the word tax advisedly, because that was
the word used in the original Bill before it passed the Committee
stage. Your Memorialists submit that the mere change of name from
tax to licence does not make it the less offensive but shows the
knowledge on the part of the framers that a special poll-tax, on a
special class of people in the Colony, is entirely repugnant to the
British notions of justice.
5* Now, your Memorialists humbly, but emphatically, submit,
that to raise the term of indenture from five years to a practically
indefinite period is extremely unjust, especially because such a

made by the Delegates, Messrs Binns and Mason, who formed the
Commission. The reasons given in that report for such legislation are

New Para:  In a country where the Native population is in number so far in excess
of the European, the unlimited settlement of Indians is not considered
desirable, and there is a general wish that when they have completed their last
period of indenture they should return to India. There are already about 25,000
free Indians settled in the Colony, many of whom have allowed their right to a
return passage to lapse; this is exclusive of a very considerable Banya trading
population!
7* Thus the reasons for the special arrangement are political
merely. Properly speaking, there is no question of overcrowding at all.
There can be none in a newly opened-up country where there are yet
vast tracts of land entirely uninhabited and uncultivated.
8* Again, in the same report, the Delegates state as follows:

9* Your Memorialists most respectfully submit that the above
extracts, which form part of the reasons given for measures restrictive
of the settlement of freed Indians in the Colony, go to prove the exact
opposite; for if the Indian traders, to which class most of your
Memorialists belong, who “do not go to the Colony under any form
of agreement”, could not be interfered with, much less the indentured
Indians, who are also equally British subjects and who are, so to speak,
invited to go to the Colony, and whose settlement (in the Delegates'
own words) “has been of great benefit to the Colony”, and who have
therefore a special claim on the goodwill and attention of the
Colonists.
10* And, if the 'Coolie' “does not come into competition to any
considerable extent with the Europeans”, where is the justification,
your Memorialists  humbly ask, for adopting measures that would
make it difficult for the indentured Indians to earn honest bread in
peace and freedom? It does not certainly lie in any qualities special to
the indentured Indians which render them dangerous members of
society. The peace-loving disposition and the mildness of the Indian
nation are proverbial. Their obedience to authorities over them is no
less prominent a trait of their character, and it would not lie in the
mouth of the Delegates to say otherwise; for the Protector, who was
one of the Delegates, in his report, at p. 15 of the same book, says:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 251, 2, 3, 569795) would have been less cause for alarm.

New Para:  The penal clause of the Bill originally was to the effect that the
Indians, failing to return to India, should pay “an annual tax to the
Government”. On  Tuesday, the Attorney-General moved that this be altered to
read: “should take out a pass or licence to remain in the Colony”, for which £3
would be payable. This is decidedly an alteration for the better, and effects the
same end under less disagreeable terms. A broad question, however, is raised
by this proposal to establish a special tax on the Coolie settlers. If such a
disability is to be placed on Coolies coming from another part of the Empire,
surely its application should be extended to include members of other non-
European races, who have no connection with the British Empire, such as
Chinese, Arabs, Kaffirs from outside States, and all such visitors. To specially
select the Coolies coming for attention in this way, and to allow all other
aliens to settle with impunity, and without disability, is not an equitable
arrangement. The practice of taxing aliens, if it is to be inaugurated at all,
should surely commence with those races not under the British flag in their
native land, and not with those who, whether we like the fact or not, are the
subjects of the same Sovereign as ourselves. These should be the last, not the
first, to be placed by us under exceptional disabilities.
18* Your Memorialists submit that the arrangement has not
appealed to any fair-minded men at all. How the Indian Government
could be persuaded by the Natal Delegates to make a promise to
sanction an indefinite extension of the indentures, or compulsory
return, no matter how reluctantly, your Memorialists do not profess to
know. But your Memorialists venture to hope that the case, as put
here, on behalf of the indentured Indians will receive full attention
from both Her Majesty's Government and the Indian Government, and
that any sanction given on the representation of an ex parte
Commission will not be allowed to prejudice the case of the
indentured Indians.

condemnation of any such idea, and I feel convinced that many who now adv

as I do. Stop Indian immigration and face results, but don't try to do what I can
show is a great wrong.

New Para:  Stop Indian immigration if you will; if there are not enough unoccupied
houses now, empty more by clearing out Arabs and Indians who live in them,
and who add to the productive and consuming power of a less than half-peopled
country. But let us trace results in this one branch of the enquiry, taking it as
an example of others and trace out how untenanted houses depreciate the value
of properties and securities—how, out of this must result stagnation in the
building trade and those other trades and stores for supplies dependent on it—
follow out how this leads to a reduced demand for white mechanics, and with
the reduction in spending power of so many, how fall of revenue is to be
expected next, need of retrenchment or taxation, or both. Let this result and
others,  far too numerous to be calculated in detail, be faced, and if blind race
sentimentalism or jealousy  is to prevail, so be it. The Colony can stop Indian
immigration, and that perhaps far more easily and permanently than some
‘popularity seekers’ would desire. But force men off at the end of their service,
this the Colony cannot do. And  I urge on it not to discredit a fair name by
trying.

New Para:  With reference to time-expired Indians, I do not think that it ought to be
compulsory on any man to go to any part of the world save for a crime for
which he is transported; I hear a great deal of this question; I have been asked
again and again to take a different view, but I have not been able to do it. A
man is brought here, in theory with his own consent, in practice very often
without his consent, (the italics are your Memorialists’) he gives the best five
years of his life, he forms new ties, forgets the old ones, perhaps establishes a
home here, and he cannot, according to my view of right and wrong, be sent
back. Better by far to stop the further introduction of Indians altogether than
to take what work you can out of them and order them away. The Colony, or
part of the Colony, seems to want Indians but also wishes to avoid the
consequences of Indian immigration. The Indian people do no harm as far as I
know; in certain respects they do a great deal of good. I have never heard a
reason to justify the extradition of a man who has behaved well for five years.
I do not think that the Indian, at the expiration of his five years’ service,
should be placed under police supervision unless he is a criminal. I know not
why Arabs should be placed under police supervision more than Europeans. In
cases of some Arabs the thing is simply ridiculous. They are men of large
means, large connections, who are always used in trade if they can be dealt
with more profitably than others.

New Para:  I think the idea which has been mooted, that all Indians should be
compelled to return to India at the end of their term of indenture, is most unfair
to the Indian population, and would never be sanctioned by the Indian
Government. In my opinion the free Indian population is a most useful section
of the community. A large proportion of them, considerably large than is
generally supposed, are in service in the Colony, particularly employed as
house servants in the towns and village. Before there was a free Indian
population the towns of Pietermaritzburg and Durban had no supply of fruit,
vegetables and fish. At present all these things are fully supplied. We have
never had any immigrants from Europe who have shown any inclination to
become market gardeners and fishermen, and I am of opinion that but for the
free Indian population, the markets of Pietermaritzburg and Durban would be as
badly supplied now as they were ten years ago (pp. 155-6).
26* The present Chief Justice and the then Attorney-General
expressed the following opinion:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 256, 2, 4, 582799) I think the idea which has been mooted, that all Indians should be compelled to return to India at the end of their term of indenture, is most unfair to the Indian population, and would never be sanctioned by the Indian Government.

New Para:  I object to any alternation in the terms of the laws under which Indians
are introduced into the Colony. In my opinion the numbers of the Indians who
have been introduced have in a great measure provided on the coast for the
failure of white immigrants, and have cultivated lands, which would otherwise
remain uncultivated with the crops which are of real advantage to the
inhabitants of the Colony. Many who have not availed themselves of the
return passage to India have turned out to be trusty and useful domestic
servants (p. 327).
27* It is yet possible to take out extracts from the same
voluminous report and evidence to show what the most distinguished
men in the Colony have thought about the arrangement.
28* Your Memorialists further beg to draw your attention to the
following from Messrs Binns and Mason’s Report:

country to which Coolies emigrated, although the consent of the Government
of India has been frequently asked for, and in no case has the condition of

with in the petitions to the Hon. the Legislative Assembly, and the

New Para:  If it were possible even for a short space of time to withdraw the whole of
the Indian population from this Colony, I am convinced that, with but very
few exceptions, every industry in existence at the present time would collapse,
solely for the want of reliable labour. There is no getting over the fact that the
Native as a rule will not work, hence it is generally admitted throughout the
Colony that without the Indian as a labourer, no industry, agricultural or
otherwise, of any importance could possibly be carried on successfully, and
not only this but almost every householder in Natal would be without domestic
servants.
31* If almost the whole current of what may be called expert
opinion, from beginning up to date, goes to show the usefulness of the
Indians, then, your Memorialists submit, it is not too much to say that
to keep such people under perpetual bondage, or to make them pay a
yearly tax of £3 whether they can afford it or not, is, to say the very
least, absolutely one-sided and selfish.
32* Your Memorialists beg respectfully to draw your attention to
the fact that, were the Bill to become law, the very object of
immigration will be frustrated in all its aspects. If it is to enable the
Indians to improve their material condition ultimately, the object
certainly will not be fulfilled by compelling them to remain under
perpetual indenture. If it be to relieve the overcrowded parts of India,
that object also will be frustrated. For, the object of the Bill is not to
allow the number of Indians in the Colony to increase. The desire is to
replace those who can no longer bear the yoke of indenture by fresh
importation, and to force the former back to India. Thus your
Memorialists humbly submit that the last state will be worse than the
first. For, while the number of Indians in the overcrowded districts, so
far as Natal as an outlet is concerned, will remain the same, those who
would return against their will cannot but be a source of additional

or any capital to maintain them, may have to be maintained at the
public expense. It may be said in reply to this objection that it presup-
poses a state of things which will never happen, that is to say, the
Indians will gladly pay the annual tax. Your Memorialists, however,
beg leave to point out that such an argument, if advanced, would
really go to prove that the clauses about re-indenture and tax are
absolutely useless, in so far as they will not produce the desired effect.
It has never been contended that the object is to raise any revenue.
33* Your Memorialists, therefore, submit that, if the Colony
cannot put up with the Indians, the only course, in your Memorialists’
humble opinion, is to stop all future immigration to Natal, at any rate
for the time being. Your Memorialists beg respectfully, but
emphatically, to protest against an arrangement that gives all the
benefit to one party only, and that, indeed, the least in need of it. Such
stopping of immigration will not, your Memorialists submit, materially
effect the congested parts of India.
34* Your Memorialists have so far discussed both the indenture
and the licence clauses together. As to the latter, your Memorialists
beg to draw your attention to the fact that even in the Transvaal—a
foreign State—the Government have not ventured to levy an annual
tax on the Indians who go there of their own accord and on their own
means. There is only a licence of £3 10s to be taken out once for all.
And this too has, your Memorialists understand, among other things,
formed the subject of a memorial
1 to Her Majesty’s Government.
Moreover, the licence in this case is an annual tax in its most
obnoxious form. This tax has to be paid whether the unfortunate
victim has the means or not. When a member, during the discussion,
asked how the tax will be collected if any Indian objected to or did
not pay it, the Hon. Attorney-General remarked that there would
always be found sufficient in the defaulting Indian’s house to attach
under a summary process!
Lastly, your Memorialists submit that the introduction of the
licence clause goes beyond the limits laid down by the Viceroy’s
Despatch referred to above.
In conclusion, your Memorialists most earnestly pray and
confidently hope that Her Majesty’s Government will come to the
conclusion that the clauses discussed herein are manifestly unjust, and

omission will not come in the way of its being averted.
Your Memorialists, with the greatest deference, venture to point
out that, if the non-compliance with the condition as to compulsory
return could not set the criminal law in motion, the insertion in the
contracts of such a clause is absolutely useless, if not actually harmful,
in as much as it might encourage the contracting party to break his
contract, and the law would connive at such a breach. And since such
extreme precaution pre-supposes the injustice of the contract, your
Memorialists respectfully submit that the reasons adduced for
inducing the sanction are absolutely insufficient, if any reasons could
justify it.
As has been hinted at in the annexure, your Memorialists
implore Your Excellency not to sanction any of the clauses objected
to, but, in accordance with the emphatically expressed opinions of Mr*
J* R* Saunders and the Hon. Mr* Escombe quoted in the annexure
1, to
stop immigration to Natal.
Your Memorialists respectfully beg to protest against any
section of Her Majesty’s subjects, be they the poorest, being
practically enslaved or subjected to a special, obnoxious poll-tax, in
order that a body of Colonists, who already have been deriving the
greatest benefits from such subjects, may be able to satisfy their whims
or desire to exact more from the same men without any return
whatsoever. In calling the idea of compulsory re-indenture, or in lieu
thereof, of a poll-tax, a whim, your Memorialists believe they have
used the right expression. For, your Memorialists firmly believe there
would be no cause for alarm even if the Indian population were
trebled in the Colony.
But, your Memorialists humbly submit that, in a matter like the
above, the wish of the Colony cannot guide Your Excellency’s
decision, but that the interests of the Indians affected by the clauses
should also be considered. And your Memorialists have no hesitation
in submitting, with all due respect, that the clauses, if ever sanctioned,
will be a grave injustice and wrong to the most helpless of Her
Majesty’s Indian subjects.
Five years’ indenture, your Memorialists submit, is long enough
to undergo. To raise it to an indefinite period would mean that an

New Para:  During the month of June in the year 1894 the Natal
Government introduced a Bill called the Franchise Law Amendment
Bill in the Legislative Assembly. It was recognized that it threatened
the very existence of the Indians in the Colony. Meetings were held
on the premises of Messrs Dada Abdulla & Co. to consider what steps
should be taken to prevent the Bill from passing. Petitions were sent to
both the Houses, Members of which were interviewed by a

institution that would cope with the legislative activity, of a retrograde
character, of the first Responsible Government of the Colony with
regard to the Indians, and protect Indian interests.
After a few preliminary meetings had been held on Messrs Dada
Abdulla’s premises, the Natal Indian Congress was formally establi-
shed on the 22nd August amidst great enthusiasm. All the leading
members of the Indian community joined the Congress. Seventy-six
members subscribed on the first evening. The list gradually rose to

members were made vice-presidents. Mr* M* K* Gandhi was elected

meetings during the early days of the Congress, the committee was
tacitly abolished and all the members were invited to the meetings.

New Para:  It will be seen from the above that, out of a possible income of
£900-8-0, the Congress has been so far successful in collecting only
£500-17-6 or nearly 50%. The 5/- subscribers have been the greatest
defaulters. The causes are many. It should be borne in mind that some
joined at a very late stage and, naturally, have not paid for the whole
year. Many have left for India, a few are too poor to pay. The most
potent cause, however, it is regrettable to mention, has been
theunwillingness to pay. It is possible to collect over 30% of the
remainder if some workers came forward and exerted themselves. The
following is a list
1 of donations, general and special, for the Bennett
case, as also the subscriptions from Newcastle and Charlestown.
The list has been given in full because these names do not
appear on the printed lists. Thus the total receipts are:
Subscriptions
£535-17-6
Donations
£ 80-17-0
£616-14-6
The above is worked on the basis of the printed list.
Now the deposits in the Bank amount to £598-19-11* In order
to arrive at the above sum the cash expenses and the transfers have to
be added.
The case expenses are £7-5-1* The transfers amount to £10-10-

There was also a difference among the prominent members as to

the Hon. Secy. and countersigned by one of the following: Mr*

Mr* Hoosen Cassim, Mr* Abdul Kadir and Mr* Dorasamy Pillay. A
suggestion was made that more should sign. At one time this
difference threatened the very existence of the Congress, but the good
sense of the members and their anxiety to prevent such a catastrophe
ultimately dispelled the cloud. And the change above mentioned was
agreed to unanimously.
As soon as the Congress was fairly started in Durban, Messrs
Dowd Mahomed, Moosa Haji Adam, Mahomed Cassim Jeeva, Mr*
Parsee Rustomjee, Mr* Peerun Mahomed and the Hon. Secy. went up,
each at his own expense, to canvass for members in P* M* Burg. A
meeting was held there and about 48 subscribed. A second similar
meeting was held at Verulam where about 37 subscribed. Mr* Hoosen
Cassim, Mr* Haji, Mr* Dowd, Mr* Moosa Haji Cassim, Mr* Parsee

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 264, 1, 13, 602208) At one time this difference threatened the very existence of the Congress, but the good sense of the members and their anxiety to prevent such a catastrophe ultimately dispelled the cloud.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 264, 1, 14, 602397) And the change above mentioned was agreed to unanimously.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 264, 1, 15, 602455) As soon as the Congress was fairly started in Durban, Messrs Dowd Mahomed, Moosa Haji Adam, Mahomed Cassim Jeeva, Mr. Parsee Rustomjee, Mr. Peerun Mahomed and the Hon.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 264, 1, 16, 602623) went up, each at his own expense, to canvass for members in P. M. Burg.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 264, 1, 17, 602695) A meeting was held there and about 48 subscribed.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 264, 1, 18, 602745) A second similar meeting was held at Verulam where about 37 subscribed.

New Para:  Mr* Somasundram, in the earlier part of the Congress year,
helped it by interpreting at the meetings and distributing circulars.
Work has also been done in Newcastle and Charlestown. Members
have subscribed for the second year.
Mr* Mahomed Sidat and Mr* Suliman Ebrahim and Mr*
Mahomed Meer worked indefatigably in Newcastle. They and Mr*
Dowd Amla went also to Charlestown at their expense. The
Charlestown people responded splendidly. Within an hour all the
available men subscribed. Mr* Dindar, Mr* Goolam Russul and Mr*
Vanda rendered much help. Nearly 1,000 letters have been written to
the friends of the Indians in England and India in connection with the
Franchise petition, Transvaal petition and the Immigration petition to
the Home Government.
The Immigration law, which contemplates imposition of a £3 tax
in lieu of indenture, has been strenuously opposed. Petitions were
presented to both the Houses.
The Transvaal petition, though not sent directly under the
auspices of the Congress, cannot but be referred to in a review of the
Congress work.
According to the spirit or the object of the Congress, an open
letter was written to members of both the Houses and widely circulated
in the Colony and South Africa. It was widely noticed by the papers
and gave rise to much sympathetic private correspondence. Letters,
too, occasionally appeared in the newspapers on the position of the
Indians in Natal. A correspondence was carried on by the late
President with the Government in connection with the separate
entrances for the Europeans and Natives and Asiatics at the Post
Office.
The result has not been altogether unsatisfactory. Separate
entrances will now be provided for the three communities. Work has
also been done among the indentured Indians. Balasundram, who was
badly treated by his master, was transferred to Mr* Askew.
The Congress interfered on behalf of the indentured Indians in
the Railway department, in connection with the Mohurrum festivals as
well as supply of wood instead of coal. Much sympathy was shown by
the Magistrate presiding.
The Tuohy case is also worthy of mention. Judgment was
recorded for Ismail Amod whose hat was taken off forcibly in a
public place and who was otherwise ill-treated.

New Para:  The famous Bennett case cost the Congress a great deal, but it is
believed that the money has not been thrown away. That we should
not get judgment against the Magistrate was a foregone conclusion.
We went to court in spite of Mr* Morecom’s opinion to the contrary.
It has, however, made the position much clearer and we know exactly
what we should do should a similar case occur in future. While the
Indian cause has not received much active support from the
Europeans in the Colony, much sympathy has been evoked both in
India and England. The London Times and The Times of India have
actively supported the Indians in South Africa. The British Committee
of the National Congress has been very vigilant. Letters of sympathy
have been received from Sir W* W* Hunter, Mr* A* Webb
1, the Hon.
Pherozeshah Mehta, the Hon. Fazalbhai Visram and others. Other
Indian and English papers have also viewed our complaints
favourably.
Mr* Askew was the only European who attended the Congress
meetings. The Congress has not yet made itself officially known to the
public because it was thought advisable not to do so unless it was
assured of a permanent existence. It has worked very quietly.
This review of the work of the Congress may close fittingly with
a mention of the address that was presented to Mr* Abdulla Haji
Adam, the late President, on his departure for India.

About 10 members have left for India, among whom may be
mentioned, besides the late president, Mr* Haji Mahomed, Mr* Haji
Suliman, Mr* Haji Dada, Mr* Manekji. Mr* Muthukrishna and Mr*

About 20 members never paid any subscription at all, who also
may be considered as having never joined the Congress.
SUGGESTIONS
The most important suggestion that has to be made is that,
whatever the subscription, it must be made payable for the whole year
in advance.
FURTHER REMARKS
It should be noted that some expenses though voted by the
Congress have not been incurred. Economy has been strictly
observed. At least £2,000 are needed to put the Congress on a sure
foundation.

The Natal Mercury

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 268, 3, 4, 609767) TO THE EDITOR The Natal Mercury
New Para:  SIR,
I would take the liberty to make a few remarks on your leader
letters on the recent cables about the Indians in South Africa. It is not
for the first time that you have said that the people in South Africa
object to give the Indians equal political rights because they do not
enjoy them in India, and that you would not object to give them the
same rights as they enjoy in India. As I have said elsewhere, I repeat
here that, in theory at any rate, the Indians do enjoy equal political
rights with the Europeans in India. The Charter of 1833 and the
Proclamation of 1858 guarantee the Indians the same rights and
privileges as are enjoyed by Her Majesty’s other subjects. And the
Indians in this Colony, as well as in other parts of South Africa, would
be quite satisfied if they could only enjoy the same rights that they
would enjoy under similar circumstances.
In India, whenever the Europeans are allowed to vote, the
Indians are not excluded. If the former have votes at the municipal
elections, so have the latter. If the former can elect or become elected
members of the Legislative Council, so can the latter.  If the former
can walk about freely after 9 p.m., so can the latter. The latter cannot
possess themselves with arms as freely as the former. The Indians in
South Africa also have no very great anxiety to arm themselves. There
is no poll-tax in India. Will you be good enough to protest against the
recent Immigration Act and earn the gratitude of the helpless
indentured Indians? It is the same recognized principle of political
equality that enabled Mr* Naoroji to enter the House of Commons. If
you object to the Indian having the same rights because “British
energy and money” have built up this Colony, you should clearly
object to the Germans and the French also. On the same principle, the
descendants of the pioneers who shed their blood may well object to
even those coming from England and pushing them out. Is this not a
narrow and selfish view of the matter? At times I read in your leaders
expressions of very lofty and humanitarian sentiments. Unfortunately
for the poor Indian, these sentiments are set aside when you deal with

New Para:  the Indian question. And yet, whether you like it or not, he is your
fellow-subject. England does not want to let go her hold of India, and
at the same time she does not want to rule her with an iron rod. Her
statesmen say that they want so much to endear the English rule to the
Indians that they would not have any other. Would not views such as
those expressed by you retard the fulfilment of those wishes?
I know very few Indians who, though they may be earning
£1,000, live as if they were earning only £50* The fact is that, perhaps,
there is no Indian in the Colony who alone earns £1,000 per year.
There are some whose trade would lead others to believe that they
must be “making a pile”. The trade of some of them is certainly very
large; not so the profit, because it is shared by many. The Indian loves
trade, and so long as he can earn a decent living, he does not mind
sharing his profit largely with others. He does not insist upon the
lion’s share. Just like the European, the Indian also loves spending his
money, only not so recklessly. Every merchant who has amassed a
fortune in Bombay has built for himself palatial buildings. The only
palatial building in Mombassa has been built by an Indian. Indian
merchants have earned much in Zanzibar, and consequently have built
palaces, and, in some instances, pleasure houses also. If no Indian has
done so in Durban of South Africa it is because he has not earned
sufficient to enable him so to do. Sir, if you will only study the
question a little more closely (pardon me for so saying), you will find
that the Indians spend in this Colony quite as much as they can
without coming to grief. To say that those earning well sleep on the
floors of their shops is, I venture to say, rather incorrect. If you would
undeceive yourself, and if you will leave your editorial chair for a few
hours, I would escort you to some Indian stores. Then, perhaps, you
would think much less harshly of them than now.
I humbly believe that the Indian question, at any rate for the
British Colonies, has a local as well as Imperial significance, and I
submit that to lose temper over it, or to shut one’s eyes to actual facts,
in order to form preconceived ideas, is not exactly the way to solve it
satisfactorily. It behoves responsible persons in the Colony not to
widen the gulf between the two communities, but, if possible, to bridge
it. Having invited the Indians to the Colony, how can the responsible
Colonists curse them? How can they escape the natural consequences
of the introduction of the Indian labour?

New Para:  SIR,
I would venture to make a few remarks in reply to Mr* T*
Marston Francis’s letter on the Indian question.
I believe your correspondent’s description of the Indian
municipalities, as also of the Legislative Councils, is not quite accurate.
To mention only one instance, I do not think that the chairman of an
Indian municipality must be a covenanted civilian. The present
president of the Bombay Corporation is an Indian solicitor.
I have never contended—nor do I contend now—that the
franchise is as extensive in India as it is here. It would also be idle for
me to say that the Legislative Councils in India are as representative as
the Legislative Assembly here. What I do contend, however, is that,
whatever the limits of the franchise in India, it is extended to all
without distinction of colour. The fact that the Indian’s ability to
understand representative government has been recognized cannot be
gainsaid. What Mr* Francis says, viz., that the qualifications for the
franchise are not the same in India as in Natal, has never been denied.
Under such a test no one coming from even Europe would be entitled
to the franchise, for the qualifications in the different European States
are not surely the same as here.
This week’s mail brings the latest proof that the Indians have
never failed in the real and only test, viz., whether or not they
understand the principle of representation. I quote from the article on
“Indian Affairs” in The Times:

New Para:  1 Controverting Gandhiji's plea for granting the franchise to Indians in South
Africa, Mr* Marston T* Francis, who had lived several years in India, wrote in The
Natal Mercury, 6-9-1895, that though Indians in India could vote at municipal
elections and become members of the Legislative Council, things were so constituted
that they could never outvote the European members or arrogate to themselves
supreme authority. The chairman of a municipality, he said, was always a covenanted
officer of the Indian Civil Service, and the Commissioner of the Division, the
Governor, the Viceroy, the Secretary of State for India, and ultimately the British
Parliament could impose checks on the municipalities and legislative bodies of India.

recognition stirs within us a pride in having such fellow-subjects. . . .
indeed, nothing could exceed their magnificent self-devotion to their
comrades in that deadly pass. . . The truth is that the Indians are
earning the right to be regarded as worthy fellow-subjects in more
ways than one. The battle-field has always formed the short cut to an
honourable equality among races. But the Indians are also proving
their title to our respect by the slower and more difficult methods of
civil life. There was a greater experiment made in the constitutional
government of dependencies than the expansion of the Indian
Legislative Council on a partially elective basis three years ago. . .
Many of the discussions have been most helpful, and so far as Bengal
is concerned—the province in which the elective system seemed
fraught with the greatest difficulty—the experiment, after a severe
trial, has proved a success.
This, as is well known, is from the pen of a historian
1 and Indian
officer who has served in India for 30 years. Disfranchisement by
itself may seem to some to be very insignificant. But its consequences
to the Indian community are too dreadful to contemplate. Its
corresponding advantages to the European Colonists, I am convinced,
are nil, unless there be anything gratifying in degrading or keeping
under degradation a race or nation. There is no question of “the
white man or the yellow man ruling”, and I hope to be able to show,
on a future occasion, that the fears entertained on that score are
entirely groundless.
There are passages in Mr* Francis’s letter which would, perhaps,
show that he must have left India very long ago. There are very few
posts more responsible than that of a civil commissioner, and yet the
Secretary of State for India only recently thought it prudent to
appoint an Indian to that post. Mr* Francis knows what jurisdiction a
Chief Justice in India enjoys, and an Indian has occupied that position
both in Bengal and Madras. Those who wish to bind the two races—
the British and the Indian—with “the silken cord of love” will not
find it difficult to notice innumerable points of contact between the
two. Even the three religions of the two, in spite of their apparent
antagonism, have much in common, and would not form a bad unity
in trinity.

premature, seeing that the case

therefore, obliged to postpone any remarks on the matter till the case

In the meanwhile, in order to remove any misimpression your
remarks may create, I would with your kind permission, set out the
objects of the Congress. They are:
“(1) To bring about a better understanding, and to promote
friendliness between the Europeans and the Indians residing in the
Colony.
“(2) To spread information about India and the Indians by
writing to newspapers, publishing pamphlets, lecturing, etc.
 “(3) To educate the Indians, especially [those] born in the
Colony, about Indian History, and induce them to study Indian
subjects.
 “(4) To ascertain the various grievances the Indians are
labouring under, and to agitate by resorting to all constitutional
methods for removing them.

The very constitution of the Congress prevented it from dealing
with private grievances, unless they have a public significance.
To say that “it has been quite through accident that the
existence of the ‘Indian Congress’ has been discovered” is hardly in
accordance with known facts. While the Congress was yet in process of
formation, The Natal Witness announced the fact, and, if I am not
mistaken, the paragraph announcing it was copied by you. It is true
that it has not been officially made known before. This was not done
because its organizers were not, and are not yet, sure of its permanent
existence. They thought it prudent to let time alone bring it to the
public notice. No attempts have been made to keep it secret. On the
other hand, its organizers even invited those Europeans who were
considered to be sympathetic either to join it or attend its fortnightly
meetings. It is only because it has begun to be misrepresented in
private conversation, and has now been publicly misrepresented (no
doubt, unconsciously) by you, that the above explanation has been
deemed necessary.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 273, 1, 3, 621527) “(6) To help the poor and the needy in all reasonable ways.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 273, 1, 4, 621587) “(7) And generally to do everything that would tend to put the Indians on a better footing morally, socially, intellectually, and politically.” The very constitution of the Congress prevented it from dealing with private grievances, unless they have a public significance.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 273, 1, 5, 621860) To say that “it has been quite through accident that the existence of the ‘Indian Congress’ has been discovered” is hardly in accordance with known facts.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 273, 1, 6, 622015) While the Congress was yet in process of formation, The Natal Witness announced the fact, and, if I am not mistaken, the paragraph announcing it was copied by you.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 273, 1, 7, 622179) It is true that it has not been officially made known before.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 273, 1, 8, 622241) This was not done because its organizers were not, and are not yet, sure of its permanent existence.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 273, 1, 9, 622342) They thought it prudent to let time alone bring it to the public notice.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 273, 1, 10, 622415) No attempts have been made to keep it secret.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 273, 1, 11, 622461) On the other hand, its organizers even invited those Europeans who were considered to be sympathetic either to join it or attend its fortnightly meetings.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 273, 1, 12, 622616) It is only because it has begun to be misrepresented in private conversation, and has now been publicly misrepresented (no doubt, unconsciously) by you, that the above explanation has been deemed necessary.

Your correspondent “H” has evidently been misinformed as to
the genesis of the Natal Indian Congress, as also with regard to other
matters. The Congress was formed chiefly by the efforts of Mr*
Abdulla Hajee Adam. I have been present at all the meetings of the
Congress, and I know that no Civil Servant has taken part in any of the
meetings. The responsibility for drafting the rules and the several
memorials rests entirely on my shoulders. Not one Civil Servant ever
saw the memorials before they were printed and ready for distribution
among the Congress members and others.

New Para:  Mr* Gandhi addressed the meeting at great length. He said now that the
existence of the Natal Indian Congress had become fully known, it was necessary
they should be punctual in paying their subscriptions. They had now £700 in hand,
being about £100 more than the last time he met them. They wanted quite £4,000 to
meet their requirements, and he said everyone should sign to promise a subscription
in a given time; every merchant who sold £100 of goods should endeavour to give 5s
to the Congress.
Mr* Gandhi said they had succeeded so far in England but they were now
awaiting the good results which will come from India. It was very likely that he (Mr*
Gandhi) would leave them in January to go to India, and he would then endeavour to
persuade a number of good Indian barristers to come to Natal.

New Para:  If the Congress has attempted, even in an indirect manner, to
tamper with a witness, it will certainly deserve suppression. I will, for
the present, content myself with repeating the statement that it has not
made any such attempt. As the judgment in which the Congress has
been condemned is under appeal, I do not feel free to deal with the
evidence at length. The only witness who was asked questions about
the Congress denied that it had anything to do with the matter. If the
doings of men in their private capacity were to be fathered upon the
association they may belong to, then I venture to think that almost any
charge could be proved against any association.
The Indians do not claim “one Indian one vote”, nor is any
vote claimed for the “Coolie” pure and simple. But then the
“Coolie” pure and simple, so long as he remains one, cannot get it
even under the existing law. The protest is only against colour or
racial distinction. If the whole question were studied coolly there
would be no occasion for any display of bad feeling or warmth by
anybody.
The Indians have in no part of the world attempted to gain
political supremacy. In Mauritius, where they are in such large

Certain remarks in the newspapers

Durban Resident Magistrate in Regina v. Rungasamy Padayachi
recently tried before him render it necessary for me to write to you, in
my capacity as Honorary Secretary for the Congress, in connection
with the remarks and the judgment referred to above.
The judgment lays down that the Congress summoned an Indian
named Asgara before it on a certain day in August and attempted to
intimidate him from giving evidence in a case, and that it is an
association of conspiracy, etc.
I have to submit that not only has the Congress never
summoned the above-named person or any other person before it
with a view to prevent him from giving evidence, but that the presiding
Magistrate had absolutely no grounds for making such remarks.
The judgment in which the remarks occur is under appeal. That
has prevented me from dealing with the matter at any length in the
Press. Unfortunately, the remarks being merely obiter dicta of the
Magistrate, may not be fully dealt with by the judges. During the
examination, cross-examination and re-examination of the witness
Asgara, the Congress was not even so much as mentioned. After the
re-examination was finished, the Magistrate asked the witness
questions about the Congress. It was made clear from the questions

New Para:  and answers that there was no meeting of the Congress during the
week during which the intimidation is supposed to have taken place.
Two printed circulars were produced, one of which was dated the 14th
August, the other the 12th September, inviting members of the
Congress to attend the meetings on the Tuesdays following the
prospective dates, i.e., on the 20th August and 17th September.
The intimidation was alleged to have happened on the 12th
August. The witness is said to have been sent for by Mahomed
Camroodeen to Moosa’s office that day, where there were present M*
C* Camroodeen, Dada Abdulla, Dowd Mahomed and two or three
strangers. Here, it is alleged, he was asked certain questions about the
case. And this the magistrate has connected with the Congress, in spite
of the witness’s evidence to the effect that the Congress meetings are
not held in Moosa’s office, that there was no circular inviting him to
the meeting at Moosa’s office, that he did not attend the meetings
convened in terms of the circulars, that the Congress meetings are held
in the Congress Hall, that the circulars had nothing to do with the case,
and that he was not present at the actual Congress meetings.
The only point that could in any way be used to support the
Magistrate’s conclusion was the fact that three out of the six or seven
men alleged to have been present at Moosa’s office were members of
the Congress.
I beg to enclose herewith the extracts from the evidence bearing
on the matter.
I venture to submit that, in some way or other, the Magistrate
was biased. In the case of Poonoosamy Pather and three others,
without a particle of evidence, he has remarked in his reasons for
judgment that the defendants are members of and have been backed
up by the Congress. As a matter of fact, all of them are not members
of the Congress and the Congress had nothing whatever to do with the
matter. As a great deal has been made of my instructing Mr* Millar in
the Rungasamy case, I may mention that I had no connection
whatever with the case of Poonoosamy and others, nor did I know, till
after the case had far advanced towards the final stage, that there was
such a case at all. My intervention was sought when Rungasamy was
charged for the same offence for the second time and then, too, not in
my capacity as Hon. Secretary of the Congress but as a lawyer.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 278, 1, 3, 630489) Two printed circulars were produced, one of which was dated the 14th August, the other the 12th September, inviting members of the Congress to attend the meetings on the Tuesdays following the prospective dates, i.e., on the 20th August and 17th September.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 278, 1, 4, 630746) The intimidation was alleged to have happened on the 12th August.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 278, 1, 5, 630812) The witness is said to have been sent for by Mahomed Camroodeen to Moosa’s office that day, where there were present M. C. Camroodeen, Dada Abdulla, Dowd Mahomed and two or three strangers.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 278, 1, 6, 631002) Here, it is alleged, he was asked certain questions about the case.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 278, 1, 7, 631070) And this the magistrate has connected with the Congress, in spite of the witness’s evidence to the effect that the Congress meetings are not held in Moosa’s office, that there was no circular inviting him to the meeting at Moosa’s office, that he did not attend the meetings convened in terms of the circulars, that the Congress meetings are held in the Congress Hall, that the circulars had nothing to do with the case, and that he was not present at the actual Congress meetings.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 278, 1, 8, 631552) The only point that could in any way be used to support the Magistrate’s conclusion was the fact that three out of the six or seven men alleged to have been present at Moosa’s office were members of the Congress.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 278, 1, 9, 631765) I beg to enclose herewith the extracts from the evidence bearing on the matter.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 278, 1, 11, 631920) In the case of Poonoosamy Pather and three others, without a particle of evidence, he has remarked in his reasons for judgment that the defendants are members of and have been backed up by the Congress.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 278, 1, 12, 632123) As a matter of fact, all of them are not members of the Congress and the Congress had nothing whatever to do with the matter.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 278, 1, 13, 632249) As a great deal has been made of my instructing Mr. Millar in the Rungasamy case, I may mention that I had no connection whatever with the case of Poonoosamy and others, nor did I know, till after the case had far advanced towards the final stage, that there was such a case at all.

Government.
Your Memorialists will not dwell upon the indignity to which the
resolution unnecessarily subjects the Indians.
The reason put forward for exemption of British subjects from
commando was chiefly that, as the British subjects were not entitled to
full Burgher Right and were subjected to disabilities in the Republic,
they should not be compelled to render military service with the
Burghers. It was openly avowed at the time the commotion was going
on that the Uitlander population of the Republic would gladly serve in
the Malaboch campaign
1, if only they were treated as citizens and
given the franchise.
If, therefore, the European or, as the resolution puts it, “White”
British subjects should be exempt because of the political disabilities
they labour under, much more, it is respectfully submitted, should the
Indian British subjects, who not only do not enjoy any political rights
in the South African Republic but are treated as little more  than
chattels, of which fact the resolution is another indication.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 282, 3, 4, 639241) AN APPEAL TO EVERY BRITON IN SOUTH AFRICA
New Para:  The question of Indian franchise has convulsed the whole
Colony, indeed the whole of South Africa, so far as the newspapers are
concerned. This appeal, therefore needs no apology. It is an attempt
to place before every Briton in South Africa, as shortly as possible, an
Indian view of the Indian Franchise.
Some of the arguments in favour of the disfranchisement of the
Indians are:
(1)  The Indians do not enjoy the franchise in India.
(2) The Indian in South Africa represents the lowest-class
Indian; in fact, he is the scum of India.
(3)  The Indian does not understand what the franchise is.
(4) The Indian should not get the franchise because the Native,
who is as much a British subject as the Indian, has none.
(5)  The Indian should be disfranchised in the interests of the
Native population.
(6)  This Colony shall be and remain a white man’s country,
and not a black man’s and the Indian franchise will simply swamp the
European vote, and give the Indian political supremacy.
I shall take the objections seriatim.

has no franchise whatever in India.
Now, the Indian in the first place does not claim any higher

Government in India is not of the same type as here. Therefore, it is
obvious there cannot be any analogy between the two. It might be said

New Para:  could get the franchise unless he enjoyed the franchise in the country
he came from in the same way and under the same circumstances, i.e.,
unless the Franchise Law of that country was the same as that of Natal.
If such a doctrine were to be of universal application, it is easy to see
that no one coming from England ever could get the franchise in
Natal, for the Franchise Law there is not the same as in Natal; much
less could a man coming from Germany or Russia, where a more
autocratic Government prevails. The only and real test, therefore, is
not whether the Indians have the franchise in India, but whether they
understand the principle of representative government.
But they have the franchise in India, extremely limited it is true;
nevertheless it is there. The Legislative Councils recognize the ability
of the Indian to understand and appreciate representative government.
They are a standing testimony to the Indian’s fitness for
representative institutions. Members of Indian Legislative Councils are
partly elected and partly nominated. The position of the Legislative
Councils in India is not very unlike that of the Legislative Council of
Natal. And the Indians are not debarred from entering those Councils.
They compete on the same terms with the Europeans.
At the last election of Members for the Legislative Council of
Bombay, the candidates for one of the constituencies were a European
and an Indian.
There are Indian Members in all the Legislative Councils of
India. Indians vote at these elections as well as the Europeans. The
franchise is certainly limited. It is also circuitous, as for example: the
Corporation of Bombay elects one Member to the Legislative Council,
and the Corporation consists of Members elected by the ratepayers,
mostly Indian.
There are thousands of Indian voters for municipal elections in
Bombay from which class, or a class similar to which, are drawn most
of the Indian traders in the Colony.
Furthermore, posts of the utmost importance are thrown open to
the Indians. Does that show as if they were considered unfit to
understand representative government? An Indian has been a Chief
Justice—an office that carries with it a salary of 60,000 rupees or

most of the traders belong to here, has been appointed Puisne Judge

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 2, 641071) could get the franchise unless he enjoyed the franchise in the country he came from in the same way and under the same circumstances, i.e., unless the Franchise Law of that country was the same as that of Natal.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 3, 641283) If such a doctrine were to be of universal application, it is easy to see that no one coming from England ever could get the franchise in Natal, for the Franchise Law there is not the same as in Natal; much less could a man coming from Germany or Russia, where a more autocratic Government prevails.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 4, 641583) The only and real test, therefore, is not whether the Indians have the franchise in India, but whether they understand the principle of representative government.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 5, 641746) But they have the franchise in India, extremely limited it is true; nevertheless it is there.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 6, 641840) The Legislative Councils recognize the ability of the Indian to understand and appreciate representative government.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 7, 641957) They are a standing testimony to the Indian’s fitness for representative institutions.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 8, 642044) Members of Indian Legislative Councils are partly elected and partly nominated.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 9, 642124) The position of the Legislative Councils in India is not very unlike that of the Legislative Council of Natal.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 10, 642235) And the Indians are not debarred from entering those Councils.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 11, 642298) They compete on the same terms with the Europeans.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 12, 642349) At the last election of Members for the Legislative Council of Bombay, the candidates for one of the constituencies were a European and an Indian.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 13, 642496) There are Indian Members in all the Legislative Councils of India.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 14, 642563) Indians vote at these elections as well as the Europeans.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 15, 642621) The franchise is certainly limited.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 16, 642657) It is also circuitous, as for example: the Corporation of Bombay elects one Member to the Legislative Council, and the Corporation consists of Members elected by the ratepayers, mostly Indian.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 17, 642850) There are thousands of Indian voters for municipal elections in Bombay from which class, or a class similar to which, are drawn most of the Indian traders in the Colony.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 18, 643020) Furthermore, posts of the utmost importance are thrown open to the Indians.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 19, 643096) Does that show as if they were considered unfit to understand representative government?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 283, 1, 20, 643185) An Indian has been a Chief Justice—an office that carries with it a salary of 60,000 rupees or £6,000 per year.

New Para:  Of the acts of daring and of the even more splendid examples of
endurance by which those honours were won, it is difficult to read without a
thrill of admiration. One Sepoy who received the Order of Merit has had no
fewer than thirty-one wounds, “probably,” says the Indian Daily News, “a
record number”. Another, shot in the defile where Ross’s party was cut up,
quietly felt out the bullet in his body and with both hands forced it, fearless of
the agony, to the surface. When at last he could get it between his fingers he
pulled it out, and then, streaming with blood, he shouldered his rifle again and
did a march of twenty-one miles.

stirs within us a pride in having such fellow-subjects, the paltry rewards doled
forth in cases of equal pluck and steadfastness awaken very different feelings.
Two water carriers of the 4th Bengal Infantry were singled out in the

mentioned for ‘the conspicuous gallantry and devotion exhibited’ while with
the party which brought the late Captain Baird into Chitral fort . . . . The truth
is that the Indians are earning the right to be regarded as worthy fellow-
subjects in more ways than one. The battlefield has always formed the short
cut to an honourable equality among races. But the Indians are also proving
their title to our respect by the slower and more difficult methods of civil life.

New Para:  The second objection is that the Indian in South Africa
represents the lowest-class Indian. The statement is hardly correct. It
will not, of course, be true as regards the trading community, nor will
it be so as to all the indentured Indians, some of whom belong to the
highest castes in Indian. They are certainly all very poor. Some of
them were vagabonds in India. Many also belong to the lowest class.
But I may be permitted to say without giving any offence that, if the
Indian community in Natal is not, nor is the European community
here, drawn from the highest class. But I venture to submit that undue
importance is given to this fact. If the Indian is not a model Indian, it
is the duty of the Government to help him to become one. And if the
reader wishes to know what a model Indian is, I beg to refer him to
my “Open Letter” where many authorities are collected to show that
he is as much civilized as a “model” European. And just as it is
competent for a lowest-class European to rise to the highest level in
Europe, so is it for the lowest-class Indian in India. By persistent
indifference, or retrogressive legislation, the Indian would be
degraded lower still in the Colony, and thus may constitute a real
danger which he was not before. Shunned, despised, cursed, he will
only do and be what others in similar positions have done and been.
Loved and well treated, he is capable of rising higher like any member
of every other nationality. He cannot be said to be well treated so long
as he is not even given those privileges which he enjoys or would
enjoy in India under similar circumstances.

New Para:  To say that the Indian does not understand the franchise is to
ignore the whole history of India. Representation, in the truest sense
of the term, the Indian has understood and appreciated from the
earliest ages. That principle —the Panchayat—guides all the actions
of an Indian. He considers himself a member of the Panchayat, which
really is the whole body civic to which he belongs for the time being.
That power to do so—that power to understand thoroughly the
principle of popular government—has rendered him the most
harmless and most docile man on earth. Centuries of foreign rule and
oppression have failed to make him a dangerous member of society.
Wherever he goes, and under whatever conditions he is placed, he
bows to the decision of the majority represented by those in authority
over him. For, he knows no one can be in authority over him, unless
he is tolerated there by a majority of the body to which he belongs.
This principle is so ingrained in the Indian heart that even the most
despotic princes of the Indian States feel that they are to rule for the
people. It is true that they do not all act up to that principle. The
causes need not be discussed here. And the most astounding fact is
that, even when nominally there is a monarchical government, the
Panchayat is the supreme body. The actions of its members are
regulated in accordance with the wish of the majority. For authorities
to support my contention I must beg leave to refer the reader to the
Franchise petition1 to the Honourable the Legislative Assembly.

I have stated this objection as I find it in the papers. It is at
variance with the fact that the Indian already enjoys the franchise in
Natal. An attempt is now being made to disfranchise him.
Without entering into comparisons, I would beg to state what are
hard facts. The Native franchise is governed by a special law which
has been in force for some years. That law does not apply to the
Indian. It has not been contended that it should apply to the Indian.

The latest argument advanced in favour of disfranchisement is
that the Indian franchise would do harm to the Native population of
the Colony. In what way this will happen is not stated at all. But, I
presume, the objectors to the Indian franchise rely upon the stock
objection to the Indian on the alleged ground that he supplies liquor
to the Natives and this spoils them. Now I venture to submit that the
Indian franchise cannot make any difference one way or the other. If
the Indians supply liquor they would not do so to any greater extent
because of their vote. The Indian vote can never become sufficiently
strong to affect the Native policy of the Colony, which is not only
jealously watched but to a very great extent controlled by the
Downing Street authorities. In fact, even the European Colonists are
powerless against Downing Street in this matter. But let us, for a
moment, look at facts. The analytical table referred to below, showing
the position of the Indian voters already on the List, shows that by far
the largest number of them are traders who, it is well known, are not
only teetotallers themselves, but would like to see liquor banished
altogether from the land, and if the Voters’ List continues to remain
so, the effect of that vote, if any, on the Native policy will be for the
better. But the following extracts from the Indian Immigration
Commission, 1885-87, show that the Indians are not worse than the
Europeans in this respect. In quoting them I disclaim any intention to
make comparisons, which I have tried to avoid as much as possible.
Nor do I wish thereby to excuse my countrymen. No one can regret
more than myself to see any Indian found drunk or supplying liquor
to Natives. I beg to assure the reader that my only wish is to show that
the objection to the Indian vote on that particular ground is merely
superficial and does not bear scrutiny.
The Commissioners, who were specially commissioned, among
other things, to report upon the charge against the Indians of drunk-
enness and crimes resulting therefrom, at pp. 42 & 43, report thus:

extent than in their own country, yet we are constrained to record that there is
no satisfactory proof before us that the percentage of drunk and disorderly
persons is greater amongst them than amongst other races dwelling within the
Colony.
Superintendent Alexander says in his evidence before the
Commission (p. 146):
    The Indians are to be considered a necessary evil at present; we cannot do
without them as labourers; we cannot do without them as storekeepers; they
are as good as the Natives; they have very much improved, but the Natives
have gone down very much; nearly all the thefts are now committed by
Natives; as far as my experience goes, the Natives obtain drink from Indians
and from everyone else who will supply them; I find some white people as bad
as Indians in this way; these are men out of employ, vagrants, who, to gain a
sixpence, will supply a Native with a bottle of liquor.

talk to many Europeans with reference to this question, and almost all

New Para:   Every man, except as hereafter excepted, above the age of twentyone years,
who possesses an immovable property to the value of £50 or who rents any
such property of the yearly value of £10 within any electoral district and who
is duly registered in the manner hereinafter mentioned, shall be entitled to
vote at the election of a member for such district. When any such property as
aforesaid is occupied by more persons than one as proprietors or renters, each
of such occupants, being duly registered, shall be entitled to vote in respect of
such property, provided the value or, as the case may be, the rent thereof be
such as would entitle each of such joint occupants to vote if equally divided
among them.
From this it is clear that it is not every Indian who can get the
franchise. And how many Indians are there in the Colony, compared
with the Europeans, who have immovable property of the value of £50
or who rent such property of the yearly value of £10? This law has
been in force for a long time, and the following table will give some
idea of the relative strength of the European and the Indian franchise.
I have compiled the table from the latest lists published in the Gazette:

Thus, out of 9,560 registered voters only 251 are Indians. And
only two divisions have Indian voters worth mentioning. The
proportion of Indians voters to the European, roughly speaking, is
1:38, i.e., the European vote at present is 38 times as strong as the
Indian vote. According to the Report of the Protector of Indian
Immigrants for 1895, out of the total Indian population of 46,343
only 30,303 are free Indians. Adding to this the trading Indian
population of, say, 5,000, we have, roughly, 35,000 freed and free
Indians. At present, therefore, the Indian population that may compete
with the European population as to voting is not so large as the
European. But I believe I am not wide of the mark in saying that more
than half of the 35,000 are only a stage higher than the indentured
Indians in point of pecuniary circumstances. I have been travelling in
the districts surrounding and within 50 miles of Durban, and I may
safely venture to assert that most of the Indians who are free are living
from hand to mouth and certainly have not immovable property
worth £50* Free Indian adults in the Colony number only 12,360*
Thus, I submit that the fears as to the Indian vote swamping the
European in the near future are entirely groundless.

Of course, this table cannot by any means be said to be
absolutely correct. I think, however, it is accurate enough for the
present purpose. Thus, so far as these figures go, the Indians who
come under indenture take 15 years or more to be able to have
sufficient property qualifications to get on the Voters’ Roll. And if
the freed Indian population were excepted, no one can say that the
trading population alone can ever swamp the Voters’ Roll. Moreover,
most of these 35 freed Indians have risen to the status of traders. Of
those who have originally come on their own means, a large majority
have taken a long time to be able to get on the Voters’ Roll. Of the 46
whom I have not been able to get identified, a great many, by their
names, appear to belong to the trading class. There are many
Colonial-born Indians in the Colony. They are also educated, and yet
on the Voters’ Roll there are only 9* This would show that they are
too poor to have the sufficient qualifications. On the whole, therefore,
it would seem that taking the present List as a basis, the fears as to the
Indian vote assuming threatening proportions are imaginary. Of the
205, over 40 are either dead or have left the Colony.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 291, 2, 14, 661470) And if the freed Indian population were excepted, no one can say that the trading population alone can ever swamp the Voters’ Roll.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 291, 2, 15, 661602) Moreover, most of these 35 freed Indians have risen to the status of traders.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 291, 2, 16, 661680) Of those who have originally come on their own means, a large majority have taken a long time to be able to get on the Voters’ Roll.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 291, 2, 17, 661813) Of the 46 whom I have not been able to get identified, a great many, by their names, appear to belong to the trading class.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 291, 2, 18, 661937) There are many Colonial-born Indians in the Colony.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 291, 2, 19, 661989) They are also educated, and yet on the Voters’ Roll there are only 9. This would show that they are too poor to have the sufficient qualifications.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 291, 2, 20, 662137) On the whole, therefore, it would seem that taking the present List as a basis, the fears as to the Indian vote assuming threatening proportions are imaginary.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 291, 2, 21, 662297) Of the 205, over 40 are either dead or have left the Colony.

This analysis also ought, I think, to assist unbiased men in
removing their fears as to the Voters’ List being swamped by
undeserving or lowest-class Indians. For, by far the greatest number
belongs to the trading or the so-called “Arab” class who, at any rate,
are acknowledged to be not quite unfit to vote.
Those classified under the second heading either belong to the
trader class or to that class of Indians who have received a tolerably
good English education.
Those belonging to the third division may be termed labourers
of a higher order—far above the average indentured Indian. They are
those who have settled in the Colony for over 20 years with their
families and either own property or pay good rents. I may say also
that, if my information be correct, most of these voters can read and
write their own mother tongue. Thus, if the present Indian Voters’ List
is to serve as a guide for the future and assuming that the franchise
qualification remains as it is, the List is very satisfactory from a
European standpoint. First, because numerically the voting strength of
the Indians is very poor, and secondly, because most (more than 3/4) of
the Indian voters belong to the trading class. It should also be borne
in mind that the number of the trading Indians in the Colony will
remain almost the same for a long time. For, while many come every
month, an equal number leaves for India. As a rule, the incoming ones
take the place of the outgoing ones.
So far I have not imported the natural proclivities of the two
communities into the argument at all but have merely dealt with the
figures. Yet, the natural proclivities will have not a little to do with the
political activity of the two. There cannot be two opinions about the
fact that the Indians, as a rule, do not actively meddle in politics. They
have never tried to usurp political power anywhere. Their religion (no
matter whether it be Mohammedan or Hindu, the teaching of ages
cannot be obliterated by a mere change of name) teaches them
indifference to material pursuits. Naturally they are satisfied so long
as they can earn a respectable living. I take the liberty to say that, had
not an attempt been made to tread upon their commercial pursuits,

condition of  pariahs of society, had not, in fact, an attempt been made
to keep them for ever “hewers of wood and drawers of water”, i.e., in
a state of indenture or in one very much resembling it, there would
have been no franchise agitation. I would go further. I have no
hesitation in saying that even now there is no political agitation in the
real sense of the term. But an attempt is, most unfortunately, being
made by the Press to father, as it were, such an agitation upon the
Indians. Leave them to follow their legitimate pursuits, do not attempt
to degrade them, treat them with ordinary kindness and there would
be no franchise question, simply because they would not even take the
trouble to have their names on the Voters’ Roll.
But it has been said, and that too by responsible persons, that a
few Indians want political power and that these few are Mahomedan
agitators and that the Hindus should learn from past experience that
the Mahomedan rule will be ruinous for them. The first statement is
without foundation and the last statement is most unfortunate and
painful. To gain political power is entirely impossible, if gaining
political power means entrance into the Legislative Assembly. Such a
statement presupposes the presence in the Colony of very wealthy
Indians having a competent knowledge of the English language. Now,
there are very few wealthy, as distinguished from well-to-do, Indians
in the Colony and there is perhaps none capable of discharging the
duties of a legislator, not because there is none capable of
understanding politics, but because there is none possessing such a
knowledge of the English language as would be expected of a
legislator.
The second statement is an attempt to set the Hindus against the
Mahomedans in the Colony. How any responsible man in the Colony
can wish for such a calamity is very wonderful. Such attempts have
been attended by the most grievous results in India and have even
threatened the permanence of British rule. To make them in this
Colony where the two sects are living most amicably is, I venture to
say, most mischievous.
It is a healthy sign that it is now recognized that to debar all
Indians from the franchise would be a grievous injustice. Some think
that the so-called Arabs should be allowed the franchise, some think
there should be a selection made among them, and some think that the
indentured Indians should never be able to get the franchise. The

New Para:  latest suggestion comes from Stanger and is most humorous. If that
suggestion were to be followed, those alone who could prove that they
were voters in India would be entitled to it in Natal. Why such a rule
for the poor Indians alone? I do not think they would object to such
an arrangement if it were applicable to all. And I should not be
surprised if the Europeans also were to find it difficult to get their
names on the Voters’ List in the Colony under such conditions. For
how many Europeans are there in the Colony who were on the
Voters’ List in the States they have come from? If, however, the
statement were made with regard to the Europeans, it would be
received with the strongest indignation. It has been received seriously
with regard to the Indians.
It has also been stated that the Indians agitate for “one Indian
one vote”. I submit that the statement is without the slightest
foundation, and is calculated to create unnecessary prejudice against
the Indian community. I believe that the 
present property
qualification is sufficient, at any rate for the present if not for all time,
to maintain the superior numerical strength of the European vote. If,
however, the European Colonists think otherwise, no Indian, I think,
will take exception to a reasonable and real educational qualification
and a larger property qualification than at present. What the Indians
do and would protest against is colour distinction—disqualification
based on account of racial difference. The Indian subjects of Her
Majesty have been most solemnly assured over and over again that no
qualifications or restrictions will be placed upon them because of their
nationality or religion. And this assurance was given and has been
repeated upon no sentimental grounds but on proof of merit. The first
note was struck after it was ascertained beyond doubt that the Indians
could be safely treated on a footing of equality, that they were most
loyal to the throne and law-abiding, and that the British hold of India
could be permanently maintained only upon those terms and no
other. That there have been serious departures from the above
assurance could, I submit, be no answer to the solid fact of its
existence. I think those departures would be exceptions to prove the
rule, they would not override it. For, if I had time and space at my
disposal, and if I were not afraid of tiring the readers’ patience, I
could quote innumerable instances in which the Proclamation of 1858
has been strictly acted upon, and is even at the present moment being
acted upon in India and elsewhere. And, surely, this is not the
occasion for a departure from it. I submit, therefore, that the Indians

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 10, 668673) It has also been stated that the Indians agitate for “one Indian one vote”.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 11, 668749) I submit that the statement is without the slightest foundation, and is calculated to create unnecessary prejudice against the Indian community.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 12, 668894) I believe that the present property qualification is sufficient, at any rate for the present if not for all time, to maintain the superior numerical strength of the European vote.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 13, 669074) If, however, the European Colonists think otherwise, no Indian, I think, will take exception to a reasonable and real educational qualification and a larger property qualification than at present.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 14, 669271) What the Indians do and would protest against is colour distinction—disqualification based on account of racial difference.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 15, 669395) The Indian subjects of Her Majesty have been most solemnly assured over and over again that no qualifications or restrictions will be placed upon them because of their nationality or religion.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 16, 669588) And this assurance was given and has been repeated upon no sentimental grounds but on proof of merit.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 17, 669690) The first note was struck after it was ascertained beyond doubt that the Indians could be safely treated on a footing of equality, that they were most loyal to the throne and law-abiding, and that the British hold of India could be permanently maintained only upon those terms and no other.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 18, 669981) That there have been serious departures from the above assurance could, I submit, be no answer to the solid fact of its existence.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 19, 670112) I think those departures would be exceptions to prove the rule, they would not override it.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 20, 670204) For, if I had time and space at my disposal, and if I were not afraid of tiring the readers’ patience, I could quote innumerable instances in which the Proclamation of 1858 has been strictly acted upon, and is even at the present moment being acted upon in India and elsewhere.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 295, 1, 21, 670482) And, surely, this is not the occasion for a departure from it.

New Para:  As regards the proposal to exclude from the exercise of the franchise all
persons of every nationality or race which is not in every respect under the
common law of the Colony, this is a provision evidently aimed at the
electoral rights at present enjoyed by the Indian and Creole population of this
Colony. As I have already stated in my report, Serial No. 12, I cannot
recognize the justice or expediency of such a measure.
The Blue-book in question contains much interesting reading
on the franchise question and shows clearly that the idea of special
disqualification was repugnant to the Colonists at the time.
The reports of the various meetings held in connection with the
franchise show that the speakers have invariably argued that the
Indians shall not be allowed to occupy this country which has been
won by European blood and which has been made what it is by
European hands, and show that the Indians are treated as intruders in
the Colony. As to the first statement, I can only say that, if the Indians
are to be denied any privileges because they have not shed their blood
for this land, the Europeans belonging to other States in Europe
should not receive the same privileges. It could also be argued that the
immigrants from England also have no business to trespass upon the
special preserve of the first white settlers. And surely, if the shedding
of blood is any criterion of merit, and if British Colonists consider the
other British dominions as portions of the British Empire, the Indians
have shed their blood for Britain on many an occasion. The Chitral
campaign is the most recent instance.
As to the Colony having been made by European hands and the
Indian being an intruder, I beg to submit that all the facts show quite
the opposite.
Without any comments of my own I shall now venture to quote
extracts from the Report of the Indian Immigrants Commission
referred to above, for a loan of which I am indebted to the Protector
of Immigrants.
Says Mr* Saunders, one of the Commissioners, at page 98:
Indian immigration brought prosperity, prices rose, people were
no longer content to grow or sell produce for a song, they could do
better; war,  high prices for wool, sugar, etc., kept up prosperity and
prices of local produce in which the Indians dealt.

the Duke of Manchester who has so identified himself with colonial interests.
He had just returned from Queensland and told his hearers that the result of an
agitation there, hostile to the introduction of coloured labour, had proved
most disastrous to those very white settlers who had hoped by checking the
supply of imported coloured labourers to destroy competition which they
wrongly imagined deprived the white settlers of work.

New Para:  In my opinion the free Indian population is a most useful section of the
community. A large portion of them, considerably larger than is generally
supposed, are in service in the Colony, particularly employed as house
servants in the towns and villages. They are also considerable producers, and
from information which I have taken some trouble to gather, I conclude that
the free Indians have grown about 100,000 mounds of maize per annum for the
last two or three years, besides considerable quantities of tobacco and other
articles. Before there was a free Indian population, the towns of
Pietermaritzburg and Durban had no supply of fruit, vegetables and fish; at
present all these things are fully supplied.

that but for the free Indian population the markets of Maritzburg and Durban
would be as badly supplied now as they were years ago.

New Para:  . . . Were Coolie immigration to be permanently stopped, the rate of
wages payable to European mechanics would probably not be affected one way
or the other, but in a very short time after such stoppage there would cease to
be as much employment for them as there is now. Tropical cultivation never
has been, and never will be, carried on without Indian labourers.

have in a great measure provided on the Coast for the failure of white
immigrants, and have cultivated lands which would otherwise remain
uncultivated, with crops which are of real advantage to the inhabitants of the
Colony. Many who have not availed themselves of the return passage to India
have turned out to be trusty and useful domestic servants.
That both the freed and free Indians have been very useful to
the Colony generally can be proved by still more overwhelming
proofs. The Commissioners in their report at page 82 say:

Indian fishing settlement on Salisbury Island, in Durban Bay, has been of
manifest advantage not only to the Indian but also to the white inhabitants of
the Colony.
  20* . . . In numerous localities in the upland as well as in the Coast
districts, they have converted waste and unproductive land into well-kept
gardens, planted with vegetables, tobacco, maize and fruit trees. Those settled
in the vicinity of Durban and Pietermaritzburg have succeeded in winning for
themselves almost entirely the supplying of the local markets with
vegetables. It must be this competition by free Indians which has worked to
the prejudice of those white Colonists who once had the monopoly of the trade
. . . In fairness to the free Indians we must observe that the competition is
legitimate in its nature and that it certainly has been welcomed by the general
community. From an early hour in the morning, Indian hawkers, male and
female, adults and children, go busily with heavy baskets on their heads from
house to house, and thus citizens can now daily, at their own doors, and at low
rates, purchase wholesome vegetables and fruit, which, not many years ago,
they could not with certainty procure even in the public markets, and at
exorbitant prices.
As to the traders the Commissioners’ report at page 74 says:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 300, 1, 3, 681395) The Indian fishing settlement on Salisbury Island, in Durban Bay, has been of manifest advantage not only to the Indian but also to the white inhabitants of the Colony.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 300, 1, 4, 681564) In numerous localities in the upland as well as in the Coast districts, they have converted waste and unproductive land into well-kept gardens, planted with vegetables, tobacco, maize and fruit trees.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 300, 1, 5, 681765) Those settled in the vicinity of Durban and Pietermaritzburg have succeeded in winning for themselves almost entirely the supplying of the local markets with vegetables.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 300, 1, 6, 681935) It must be this competition by free Indians which has worked to the prejudice of those white Colonists who once had the monopoly of the trade .

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 300, 1, 9, 682627) As to the traders the Commissioners’ report at page 74 says:
New Para:  We are convinced that much of the irritation existing in the minds of
European Colonists against the whole Indian population of the Colony has
been excited by the undoubted ability of these Arab traders to compete with
European merchants, and specially with those who have chiefly directed their
attention to the supply of articles, notably rice, largely consumed by the
Indian immigrant population. . . .
We are of opinion that these Arab traders have been drawn to Natal by
the presence therein of those Indians who have been introduced under the
Immigration Laws. Rice is the chief food of the 30,000 Indian immigrants
now in the Colony, and these astute traders have so successfully devoted their
tact and energy to the supply of that article that the price to all consumers fell
from 21s per bag in former years to 14s in 1884* . . .
It is said that Kaffirs can buy from Arabs at from 25 to 30 per cent lower
rates than those obtaining six or seven years ago.
It does not lie within the scope of our Commission to discuss at length
the restrictive measure which some desire to impose upon Asiatics or “Arab”
trader. We are content to place on record our strong opinion, based on much
observation, that the presence of these traders has been beneficial to the
whole Colony, and that it would be unwise, if not unjust, to legislate to their
prejudice (the italics are mine).

New Para:  Out of the 72 European witnesses who gave their evidence before the
Commission, almost every one of those who spoke as to the presence of the
Indian affecting the Colony has said that he is indispensable for its welfare.
I have quoted the extracts at some length not to argue therefrom
that the Indians should have the franchise (they have it already), but to
refute the charge that the Indian is an intruder and the statement that
he has nothing to do with the prosperity of the Colony. “The proof
of the pudding lies in the eating.” The best proof is that, no matter
what is being said against the Indians, they are yet wanted; the
Protector’s Department is unable to cope with the demand for Indian
labour.
At page 5 of the Annual Report, 1895, the Protector says:

New Para:  At the close of last year there was an unsupplied balance of 1,330 men to
complete the year’s indent. In addition to this number, 2,760 men were
applied for to arrive in 1895, making a total of 4,090* Of this number, 2,032
arrived during the year under report (1,049 from Madras and 983 from
Calcutta), leaving a balance of 2,058 (less 12 men lapsed requisitions) to
arrive during the present year to complete the last year’s indent.
If the Indian is really harmful to the Colony, the best and justest
method is to stop further immigration and, in due course, the present
Indian population will cease to trouble the Colony much. To have
them under conditions that mean slavery is hardly fair.
If then this appeal has at all satisfactorily answered the various
objections raised to the Indian franchise; if the reader accepts the
assertion that the franchise agitation on the part of the Indians is
merely a protest against degradation, which the counteragitation
contemplates, and not an attempt to gain political power or influence,
I humbly think I am justified in asking the reader to pause and
consider before he decides to oppose the Indian franchise tooth and
nail. Although the “British subject” idea has been rejected by the
Press as a craze and fad, I have to fall back upon that idea. Without it
there would have been no franchise agitation whatever. Without it
there would probably have been no State-aided immigration. Very
probably the Indian would have been an impossibility in Natal if he
were not a British subject. I, therefore, appeal to every Briton in South
Africa not to lightly dismiss the “British  subject”  idea from his
mind.  The Proclamation of 1858 was Her Majesty’s acts, presumably

according to the advice of her then advisers, in whom the voters, by
their votes, had reposed their full trust. India belongs to England and
England does not wish to lose her hold of India. Every act done by a
Briton towards an Indian cannot but have some effect in moulding the
final relations between Britons and Indians. It is, moreover, a fact that
the Indian is in South Africa because he is a British subject; he has to
be tolerated whether one likes it or not. Is it not then better that
nothing should be done that would unnecessarily embitter the feelings
between the two communities? By coming to a hasty conclusion, or by
forming conclusions on groundless assumptions, it is not at all
unlikely that injustice may unintentionally be done to the Indians.
The question in the minds of all reasonable men, I submit,
should be not how to drive away the Indians from the Colony (for that
is impossible), but how to bring about satisfactory relations between
the two communities. Even from a most selfish point of view, I submit,
no good can result from an attitude of unfriendliness and hatred
towards the Indians, unless there is any pleasure in creating in one’s
mind an unfriendly feeling towards one’s neighbour. Such a policy is
repugnant to the British Constitution and the British sense of justice
and fair play, and above all hateful to the spirit of Christianity which is
professed by the objectors to the Indian franchise.
I appeal more particularly to the Press, the public men
throughout South Africa and the Clergy: Public opinion is in your
hands. You mould and guide it. It is for you to consider whether the
policy hitherto pursued is the right and proper one to continue. Your
duty as Britons and leaders of public opinion cannot be to divide the
two communities but to weld them together.
The Indians have many blemishes and they are themselves, no
doubt, to blame to some extent for the present unsatisfactory state of
feelings between the two peoples. My object is to induce you to
believe that the blame does not entirely lie on one side alone.
Often and often have I read in the papers and heard that the
Indians have nothing to complain about. I submit that neither you nor
the Indians here are capable of forming an impartial judgment. I,
therefore, draw your attention entirely to the outside public opinion,
to the Press, alike in England and India, which is practically

New Para:  These particulars are enough to throw light upon the hateful persecution
to which British Indian subjects are being subjected. The new Indian
Immigration Law Amendment Bill, which virtually proposes to reduce Indians
to a state of slavery, is another example. The thing is a monstrous wrong, an
insult to British subjects, a disgrace to its authors, and a slight upon
ourselves. Every Englishman is concerned to see that the commercial greed of
the South African trader is not permitted to wreak such bitter injustice upon
men who alike by Proclamation and by Statute are placed upon an equality with
ourselves before the Law.
If I could but convince you that the ‘greatest kindness’ is not
shown to the Indian in South Africa and that the Europeans are also to
blame for the prevailing state of things, a way will have been paved for
a dispassionate discussion of the whole Indian question, and perhaps it
will be solved without any intervention from Downing Street to the
satisfaction of both the parties concerned. Why should the Clergy
remain silent on this momentous question, momentous because it
affects the future of South Africa? They do take part in politics pure
and simple. They do attend the meetings convened to urge the
disfranchisement of the Indians. But this is not merely a political
question. Will they see a race degraded and insulted because of the
‘unreasoning’ prejudice against it and sit still? Is such indifference
sanctioned by Christ’s Christianity?
I repeat again, it is not political power that the Indians want. It is
degradation, it is many other consequences and measures that will
flow from and will be based on the disfranchisement that they dread
and resist.

New Para:  In conclusion, I shall be deeply indebted to those who would
read this and be kind enough to express their opinion about its
subject-matter. Many Europeans have privately expressed their
sympathy for the Indians and have strongly disapproved of the
sweeping resolutions passed at the various meetings held in the
Colony in connection with the Indian  franchise and the bitter tone of
the speeches made. If these gentlemen will come forward and have the
courage of their convictions, I submit, they will have a fourfold
reward. They will earn the gratitude of the 40,000 Indians in the
Colony, indeed of the whole of India, and will render true service to
the Colony by disabusing the minds of the Europeans of the notion
that the Indian is a curse to the Colony; they will serve humanity by
rescuing or assisting to rescue a portion of an ancient race from
unwarranted persecution which they know exists in the whole of South
Africa, and last but not least, in common with the noblest Britons, be
the forgers of the links that will unite England and India in love and
peace. I humbly submit that such an achievement is worth a little
ridicule that the pioneers will be subjected to. To separate the two
communities is easy enough, to unite them by the ‘silken cord’ of
love is equally difficult. But then, everything that is worth having is
also worth a great deal of trouble and anxiety.
The Natal Indian Congress has been mentioned in connection
with this matter and has been much misrepresented. In a separate
pamphlet
1 its objects and methods of working will be fully discussed.
While this was in course of preparation, Mr* Maydon made a
speech at Bellair and a curious resolution was passed at the meeting.
With the greatest deference to the honourable gentleman, I venture to
take exception to his statement that the Indians have ever remained in
a state of servitude and are, therefore, unfit for self-government.
Although he invoked the aid of history in support of his statement, I
venture to say that history fails to bear out the statement. In the first
place Indian history does not date from the invasion of Alexander the
Great. But I take the liberty to say that India of that date will compare
very favourably with Europe of today. In support of that statement I
beg to refer him to the Greek description of India at pp. 169-70 of
Hunter’s Indian Empire, partly quoted in my “Open Letter”. What,
however, of India of a period previous to that date? History says that

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 304, 1, 5, 692579) They will earn the gratitude of the 40,000 Indians in the Colony, indeed of the whole of India, and will render true service to the Colony by disabusing the minds of the Europeans of the notion that the Indian is a curse to the Colony; they will serve humanity by rescuing or assisting to rescue a portion of an ancient race from unwarranted persecution which they know exists in the whole of South Africa, and last but not least, in common with the noblest Britons, be the forgers of the links that will unite England and India in love and peace.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 304, 1, 6, 693127) I humbly submit that such an achievement is worth a little ridicule that the pioneers will be subjected to.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 304, 1, 7, 693235) To separate the two communities is easy enough, to unite them by the ‘silken cord’ of love is equally difficult.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 304, 1, 13, 693974) Although he invoked the aid of history in support of his statement, I venture to say that history fails to bear out the statement.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 304, 1, 14, 694105) In the first place Indian history does not date from the invasion of Alexander the Great.

New Para:  the Aryans’ home was not India but they came from Central Asia, and
one family migrated to India and colonized it, the others to Europe.
The government of that day was, so history says, a civilized
government in the truest sense of the term. The whole Aryan literature
grew up then. The India of Alexander’s time was India on the decline.
When other nations were hardly formed, India was at its zenith, and
the Indians of this age are descendants of that race. To say, therefore,
that the Indians have been ever under servitude is hardly correct. India
certainly has not proved unconquerable. If that be reason for
disfranchisement, I have nothing to say except this, that every nation
will, unfortunately, be found wanting in this respect. It is true England
“wafts her sceptre” over India. The Indians are not ashamed of that
fact. They are proud to be under the British Crown, because they
think that England will prove India’s deliverer. The wonder of all
wonders seems to be that the Indians, like the favoured nation of the
Bible, are irrepressible in spite of centuries of oppression and
bondage. And many British writers think that India is under England
with her consent.

average, a fifth part was English. In the early battles of the Company, by
which its power was decisively established, at the siege of Arcot, at Plassey,
at Buxar, there seems always to have been more Sepoys than Europeans on the
side of the Company. And, let us observe further, that we do not hear of the
Sepoys fighting ill, of the English as bearing the whole brunt of the conflict .

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 306, 3, 9, 698198) 83. VEGETARIANISM IN NATAL
New Para:  It is an uphill battle to fight in Natal, and, indeed, in South Africa.
Yet there are few places where vegetarianism would be more
conducive to health, or more economical or practicable. Of course, at
present, it is hardly economical and it certainly requires a great deal of
self-denial to remain a vegetarian, To become one seems almost an
impossibility. “It is all very well in London, where there are scores of
vegetarian restaurants, but how can you become or remain a
vegetarian in South Africa, where you find very little nourishing
vegetarian food?” has been the invariable reply to my enquiries, in
the course of conversation on the matter with scores of men. One
would have thought such a reply would be impossible in South Africa,
seeing that it enjoys a semi-tropical climate, and its vegetable
resources are inexhaustible. Nevertheless, the reply is entirely
justifiable. In the best of hotels you find, as a rule, potatoes the only
vegetable at lunch-time, and that badly cooked. At dinner-time you
find, perhaps, two vegetables, and the vegetable menu is hardly ever
changed. It is little short of a scandal that in this Garden Colony of

neighbouring townships. Nuts can only be bought at Christmas time.
Such are the present circumstances. Vegetarian friends, therefore,
need not wonder if I can report very little perceptible progress as a
result of nearly nine months’ advertising and quiet persuasion. Nor
are the above the only difficulties in the way of vegetarian
propaganda. People here think of very little else than gold. The gold
fever is so infectious in these regions that it has smitten the highest

higher pursuits of life; they find no time to think of the beyond.

Many more have been distributed. Correspondence and conversation
have not been devoid of humour. A lady, who corresponded with me
in connection with Esoteric Christianity, became angry on finding that
Esoteric Christianity had anything to do with vegetarianism. She was
so disgusted that she returned the books lent to her without reading

slaughter an animal. “He would not do it for the life of him.” But he

attention from the Johannesburg gold to the quieter method of
earning money by cultivation, and to get rid of their colour prejudice,
there is no doubt that every variety of vegetable and fruit could be
grown in Natal. The climate of South Africa is such that the
Europeans alone will never be able to work the soil as much as is

Vegetarians, therefore, have a scope for patriotic work. The line of
marriage between white British subjects and Indians is getting thicker
day by day in South Africa. The best English and Indian statesmen
are of opinion that Britain and India can be indissolubly united by the
chain of love. The spiritualists anticipate good results from such a
union. The South African white British subjects are doing their utmost
to retard, and, if possible, to prevent such a union. It may be that some
vegetarians may come forward to arrest such a catastrophe.
I would venture to make one suggestion and then close this
hurriedly written resume of the work in Natal. If some men of means,
and well up in vegetarian literature, were to travel in different parts of
the world, explore the resources of the different countries, report upon
their possibilities from a vegetarian standpoint, and invite vegetarians
to migrate to those countries which they may consider suitable for
vegetarian propaganda, and, at the same time, worth settling in from a
pecuniary point of view, much vegetarian work can be done, openings
can be found for poor vegetarians, and real centres of vegetarianism
can be established in various parts of the world.
But then vegetarianism, in order to do this, should be a religion,
and not merely a hygienic convenience. The platform will have to be
shifted much higher.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 308, 1, 11, 703013) If some men of means, and well up in vegetarian literature, were to travel in different parts of the world, explore the resources of the different countries, report upon their possibilities from a vegetarian standpoint, and invite vegetarians to migrate to those countries which they may consider suitable for vegetarian propaganda, and, at the same time, worth settling in from a pecuniary point of view, much vegetarian work can be done, openings can be found for poor vegetarians, and real centres of vegetarianism can be established in various parts of the world.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 308, 1, 12, 703581) But then vegetarianism, in order to do this, should be a religion, and not merely a hygienic convenience.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 308, 1, 13, 703687) The platform will have to be shifted much higher.

New Para:  SIR,
As one  interested in food reform, permit me to congratulate
you on your leader in Saturday’s issue on “The New Science of
Healing”, which lays so much stress on the adoption of the natural
food, i.e., vegetarianism, But for the unfortunate characteristic of this
“self-indulgent” age, in which “nothing is more common than to
hear men warmly supporting a theory in the abstract without any
intention of submitting to it in practice”, we should all be vegetarians.

New Para:  For, why should it be otherwise when Sir Henry Thompson calls it “a
vulgar error” to suppose that flesh foods are indispensable for our
sustenance, and the most eminent physiologists declare that fruit is the
natural food of man, and when we have the example of Buddha,
Pythagoras, Plato, Porphyry, Ray, Daniel, Wesley, Howard, Shelley, Sir
Isaac Pitman, Edison, Sir W* B* Richardson, and a host of other
eminent men as vegetarians? The Christian vegetarian claim that Jesus
was also a vegetarian, and there does not seem to be anything to
oppose that view, except the reference to His having eaten broiled fish
after the Resurrection. The most successful missionaries in South
Africa (the Trappists) are vegetarians. Looked at from every point of
view, vegetarianism has been demonstrated to be far superior to
flesheating. The Spiritualists hold, and the practice of the religious
teachers of all the religions, except, perhaps, the generality of
Protestant teachers shows, that nothing is more detrimental to the
spiritual faculty of man than the gross feeding on flesh. The most
ardent vegetarians attribute the agnosticism, the materialism, and the
religious indifference of the present age to too much flesheating and
wine-drinking, and the consequent disappearance, partial or total, of
the spiritual faculty in man. Vegetarian admirers of the intellectual in
man point to the whole host of the most intellectual men of the world,
who were invariably abstemious in their habits, especially at the time
of writing their best works, to demonstrate the sufficiency, if not the
superiority of the vegetarian diet from an intellectual standpoint. The
columns of the vegetarian magazines and reviews afford a most
decisive proof that where beef and its concoctions, with no end of
physic thrown in, have lamentably failed, vegetarianism has
triumphantly succeeded. Muscular vegetarians demonstrate the
superiority of their diet by pointing out that the peasantry of the
world are practically vegetarians, and that the strongest and most
useful animal, the horse, is a vegetarian, while the most ferocious and
practically useless animal, the lion, is a carnivore. Vegetarian moralists
mourn over the fact that selfish men would—for the sake of gratifying
their lustful and diseased appetite—force the butcher’s trade on a
portion of mankind, while they themselves would shrink with horror
from such a calling. They moreover lovingly implore us to bear in
mind that without the stimulants of flesh foods and wine it is difficult
enough to restrain our passions and escape Satan’s clutches, and not
to add to those difficulties by resorting to meats and drinks which, as a
rule, go hand in hand. For, it is claimed that vegetarianism, in which
juicy fruits find the foremost place, is the safest  and surest cure for
drunkenness, while meat-eating induces or increases the habit. They
also argue that since meat-eating is not only unnecessary but harmful

contradiction, assert that vegetarian foods are the cheapest diet, and
their general adoption will go a long way towards mitigating, if not
altogether suppressing, the rapidly growing pauperism side by side
with the rapid march of the materialistic civilization and the
accumulation of immense riches in the hands of a few. So far as I
recollect, Dr* Louis Kuhne urges the necessity of vegetarianism on
physiological grounds only, and does not give any hints for
beginners, who always find it difficult to select the right kinds from a
variety of vegetarian foods and to cook them properly. I have a

treatises on the subject dealing with its various aspects. The cheapest

fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is

Your Memorialists interpret the rules to mean exclusion of Her
Majesty’s Indian subjects from owning or acquiring property in the
Nondweni Township.
Your Memorialists beg respectfully but emphatically to protest
against the invidious distinction thus drawn between European and
Indian British subjects.
Nor can your Memorialists find any reason for such exclusion,

Your Memorialists humbly submit that such preference given to
one portion of Her Majesty’s subjects over another is not only
contrary to the British policy and justice, but, in the case of the Indian
community, violates the terms of the Proclamation of 1858 which
entitles British Indians to equal treatment with the Europeans.
Your Memorialists venture further to submit that, in view of the
efforts of Her Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Indians
residing in the Transvaal, the distinction drawn by the rules under
discussion with regard to property rights is somewhat strange and
inconsistent.
Your Memorialists would crave leave to mention that many
Indians own freehold property in other parts of Zululand.
Your Memorialists, therefore, humbly pray that, by virtue of the
power reserved by Section 23 of the Regulations, Your Excellency will
be pleased to order such alteration or amendment thereof as to do
away with the above-mentioned distinction.

duty bound, shall for ever pray, etc., etc.

New Para:  SIR,
In justice to the two defendants, Roberts and Richards, whom the
worthy Superintendent of Police is pleased to call “upstarts” and
other bad names, and in justice to the Indian community, I beg to
encroach upon your space with reference to the partial report of the
case in which the two defendants were charged under the Vagrancy
Law and the Superintendent’s views thereon that appeared in your
issue of the 29th February. The report and the opinion would seem to
show that Mr* Waller’s decision
1 is a miscarriage of justice. To give
colour to that view, the Superintendent has elected to give that portion
of the evidence which I wished, and still wish, to use in order to win

I humbly think that theirs was a very hard case, and that the
police erred in arresting them, and, afterwards, in harassing them. I
said in the Court, and I repeat, that the Vagrant Law would cease to be
oppressive if the police showed some consideration for the Indians
and used discretion in arresting them. The fact that both are sons of
indentured Indians should not go against them, especially in an
English community, where a man’s worth, not birth, is taken into
account in judging him. If that were not so, a butcher’s son would not
have been honoured as the greatest poet. The Superintendent, then,
makes much of the fact that the second defendant changed his name
about two years ago, and tries thereby to excuse the wanton insult

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 313, 2, 3, 714314) SIR, In justice to the two defendants, Roberts and Richards, whom the worthy Superintendent of Police is pleased to call “upstarts” and other bad names, and in justice to the Indian community, I beg to encroach upon your space with reference to the partial report of the case in which the two defendants were charged under the Vagrancy Law and the Superintendent’s views thereon that appeared in your issue of the 29th February.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 313, 2, 4, 714743) The report and the opinion would seem to show that Mr. Waller’s decision 1 is a miscarriage of justice.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 313, 2, 5, 714847) To give colour to that view, the Superintendent has elected to give that portion of the evidence which I wished, and still wish, to use in order to win public sympathy for the two defendants, and what is more, for people placed in a similar position.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 313, 2, 6, 715098) I humbly think that theirs was a very hard case, and that the police erred in arresting them, and, afterwards, in harassing them.

was going home, it was sufficient answer to clear himself, as the law stated that only
a coloured person found wandering between the hours of 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. without a
pass from his employer, or not giving a good account of himself, may be arrested.

New Para:  be remembered that the constable in charge knew nothing whatever as
to when the name was changed, and surely his very features were
sufficient to betray his nationality had he attempted, as the
Superintendent supposes he did, to cover his nationality in order to
escape the operation of the Vagrant Law. Nor did he seem to be
ashamed of his name or birth, for the answers came almost
simultaneously with the questions as to birth and name, and seemed so
much to please the amiable Superintendent as to extort the following
expression from him: “Yes, my boy, if all were like you, the police
would have no difficulty.”
There can be nothing absolutely wrong in changing one’s name
unless it is wrong to change one’s religion. To compare small things
with great, Mr* Quilliam has become Haji Abdullah because he has
become a Mahomedan. Mr* Webb, the late Consul-General of Manica,
also adopted a Mahomedan name, on adopting the Mahomedan faith.
Not only the Christian name but the Christian dress also is an offence
for an Indian,  according to the view of the constables. And now,
according to the Superintendent’s view, change of religion would
render an Indian liable to suspicion. But why should this be so,
assuming, of course, that the change is a result of honest belief and
not a dodge to evade the law? In the present case I assume that both
the defendants are honest Christians because I am told both are
respected by Dr* Booth
1* Of course, the Superintendent will report,
“But how is a man to know whether a man is an honest Christian or a
Satan in the Christian garb?” This is a difficult question to answer. I
submitted to the Court that each case could be judged on its own
merits, and that the benefit of the ordinary presumptions should be
given to the Indians, as it is given to other classes.
I submitted that two men, wearing a respectable dress, walking
quietly along the main street at 9*30 p.m., stopping when questioned,
protesting that they were returning from the  gardens and were on
their way home, which was not seven minutes’ walk from the place
where they were stopped, that one of them was a clerk and the other a
teacher (as was the case with the two unfortunate boys), may be given
the benefit of the ordinary presumption. I submitted further that in

as respectable men under custody and not be prejudged to be thieves
and robbers. The remarks about dress and religion and name might
conveniently be postponed till they could be proved to be hypocrites.
About a year ago I was travelling from Standerton to Durban.
Two of my fellow-passengers were suspected to be thieves. Their
luggage, and with theirs mine also, because I was in the same
compartment, was examined at Volksrust, and a detective was placed
in the compartment. They could offer a glass of whisky to the
Landdrost
1, who came to examine the luggage and talk to the detective
as gentlemen and on equal terms, presumably because they were
respectably dressed and were first-class passengers. The detective did
not prejudge them. I must not omit to mention that they were
Europeans. The detective all the way through was sorry that he had to
perform the unpleasant duty. May I plead for the same treatment in
cases like that of the unfortunate boys? Instead of the cell they might
have been given some other place to lie in. They might have been
given clean blankets to lie on if the cell could not be avoided. The
constables might have spoken to them kindly. Had this been done the
case would never have come before the Magistrate.
I venture to take exception to the Superintendent’s statement
that “these young upstarts elected to be locked up all night in
preference to bail”. The reverse is the truth. They offered bail and it
was refused during the night. The Magistrate was not pleased with this
treatment. They renewed their request to be bailed out in the morning.
The request of the second defendant was granted. The constable
refused to bail out the first. Against his name was marked: “not to be
released”. The book containing that remark was produced in the
Court. Later, he was released at the instance of Inspector Benny, who
promptly remedied the mistake as soon as he came to know of it.
With deference to the Superintendent, I beg to say that the first
defendant did not defy the law. The Magistrate made no order; but he,
in his fatherly and kind manner, suggested that I should advise him to
get the Mayor’s Pass
2* I submitted that such was not necessary but said
that in deference to his suggestion I would do so. The defendant has
now received a reply from the Town Clerk that the pass will not be

replaces the Act of 1894 against which a Memorial

Your Memorialists hereby venture to approach Her Majesty’s
Government with regard to certain Rules and Regulations in
connection with the Township of Nondweni, Zululand, published in
the Natal Government Gazette dated the 25th February, 1896, in so far
as the said Regulations affect the rights of Her Majesty’s Indian
subjects to own or acquire property in the Township of Nondweni, as
also with regard to similar Regulations for the Township of Eshowe in
Zululand.
The portion of the Regulations affecting the British Indians is as
follows:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 320, 4, 5, 727558) HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT: Your Memorialists hereby venture to approach Her Majesty’s Government with regard to certain Rules and Regulations in connection with the Township of Nondweni, Zululand, published in the Natal Government Gazette dated the 25th February, 1896, in so far as the said Regulations affect the rights of Her Majesty’s Indian subjects to own or acquire property in the Township of Nondweni, as also with regard to similar Regulations for the Township of Eshowe in Zululand.

condition any such sites or erven shall revert to the Government as in the
preceding section hereof.

erven or sites are sold, and which condition shall be inserted in every freehold
title applied for and issued in terms of Sections 10, 11 and 13 of the
Regulations, that at no time shall the owner of sites or erven in the Nondweni
Township bought hereunder be at liberty either to sell or let such sites or erven
or any portion thereof or to permit occupation of them or any portion thereof

New Para:  The next day after the publication of the Gazette containing the
Nondweni Regulations your Memorialists petitioned His Excellency
the Governor of Zululand praying that the Regulations may be so
altered or amended as to do away with the colour distinction therein.
In reply to the said Memorial
1 a copy whereof is annexed
hereto, your Memorialists were informed that the Regulations were
“the same as the Regulations in force for the Eshowe Township
proclaimed by His Excellency’s predecessor on 28th September
1891”. Thereupon a request was made, on the 4th March, 1896, to
the effect that both the Regulations should be altered or amended with
regard to the British Indians.
A reply thereto was received on 5th March 1896, to the effect
that the Governor did not feel justified in acting on the suggestion.
Your Memorialists confidently trust that the wrong inflicted
upon the Indian community is so manifest that it has only to be
brought to the notice of Her Majesty’s Government to be remedied. If
such an invidious and, your Memorialists respectfully submit,
unnecessary distinction cannot be permitted in self-governing
colonies, much less should it be permitted in a Crown Colony.
Many of your Memorialists own property in Zululand. In the
year 1889, when the Township of Melmoth was sold, the Indian
community laid out nearly £2,000 in the purchase of erven in that
Township.
Your Memorialists respectfully submit, it is absolutely necessary
that the Indian community should be allowed to purchase land in
Zululand freely, if only for the reason that they may be able to make
their outlay of the £2,000 profitable.
Even the Government organ
2 in   Natal considered the wrong so
serious that, though as a rule hostile to the Indian aspirations, it viewed
the Memorial to the Government of Zululand very favourably. The
remarks are so apt that your Memorialists crave leave to quote them
below:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 321, 1, 2, 729390) The next day after the publication of the Gazette containing the Nondweni Regulations your Memorialists petitioned His Excellency the Governor of Zululand praying that the Regulations may be so altered or amended as to do away with the colour distinction therein.

New Para:  number of sections which specially prevent all but persons of European birth
or descent from purchasing property in the township, or even occupying any
property in the township. The Indians, ever to the fore in such matters, have
promptly sent a protest to the Governor against the promulgation of such
rules and regulations, and seeing that  Zululand is still a Crown Colony, and,
therefore, more under the direct eyes of the Imperial authorities, we cannot
very well see how such rules can be enforced when there is evidently so strong
a disposition on the part of the Home Government to prevent the Franchise
Law Amendment Bill passed in Natal from becoming law. From the protest
presented by the Indians, we gather that some of them already own freehold
property in Zululand, and, if this be the case, apart from any other reason, it
seems to us the Memorialists have a cause for consideration. There may be
some special provision as regards the occupation of land in the Zulu country
which prohibits Indians from becoming property-holders, but still the fact
remains that the territory is a Crown Colony, and this being so, it seems
strange that rules and regulations can be made for that country which are not
permitted in Natal, a responsibly-governed Colony.
So frequently do the colour distinctions creep in into the rules
and regulations, laws and bye-laws published in various parts of South
Africa, that it is impossible for the Indian community, consisting, as it
does, chiefly of traders and artisans with a knowledge sufficient only
for the requirements of trade and, in many cases, even without it, to
keep itself informed of all the legislation affecting its rights and bring
it to the notice of Her Majesty’s Government.
And things have come to such a pass that your Memorialists
cannot expect redress from the local authorities, even in cases where
the wrong complained of is a result of an oversight of the
fundamental principles of the British Constitution, as in the present
instance.
Your Memorialists fear that, if a Crown Colony can refuse
property rights to a portion of Her Majesty’s subjects, the
Governments of the South African Republic and the Orange Free
State would in a greater measure be justified in doing likewise or even
going further.
Your Memorialists submit that the existence of the colour
distinction in the Regulations for Eshowe should not be a justification
for similar Regulations for Nondweni. If those for Eshowe are bad,
rather, your Memorialists submit, should both be altered and amended
so as not to affect the just rights of the British Indian subjects.

New Para:  Your Memorialists further venture to draw your attention to the
fact that constant class legislation affecting Her Majesty’s Indian
subjects not only causes a great deal of anxiety to the Indian
community in South Africa, but the petitions that have to be
frequently made to have such legislation altered cause a great deal of
expense which the Indian community, by no means in an over-
prosperous condition can ill afford to incur, not to mention the fact
that such a state of constant unrest and irritation seriously interferes
with the business of the Indian community as a whole.
Nothing short of an enquiry into the position and status of the
British Indians in South Africa, and a notification calling upon the
authorities in South Africa to ensure the equality of treatment of Her
Majesty’s Indian subjects with all the other British subjects will, in
your Memorialists’ humble opinion, prevent the social and  civil
extinction of Her Majesty’s loyal and law-abiding Indian subjects.
Your Memorialists, therefore, humbly pray that Her Majesty’s
Government will order alteration or amendment of the Eshowe and
Nondweni Townships Regulations so as to remove the disabilities that
they, in their present form, entail on Her Majesty’s Indian subjects,
and further humbly suggest that orders may be issued forbidding
future class legislation affecting them.
And for this act of justice and mercy, your Memorialists, as in
duty bound, shall for ever pray, etc., etc.

New Para:  date 11th March last, and did me the honour to criticize my pamphlet
1
on the Indian franchise.
While I thank “G.W.W*” for the personal fairness he has shown
me in his treatment of the pamphlet, I wish he had treated the subject-
matter of the “Appeal” as fairly. If he had read it with an unbiased
mind, I think he would not have found any cause to differ from the
views therein expressed. I have endeavoured to  treat the subject from
such a standpoint as would induce the European Colonists to extend
ungrudgingly the hand of fellowship to the Indians without being
elbowed out of their present position in so doing. I still maintain that
there is no cause whatever for alarm, and if the European Colonists
would only let the agitation die and consent to resume the status quo,
they  would find that their vote would not be swamped by the Indians.
I further submit that, if ever such a contingency were to arise, it could
be dealt with in anticipation, without the necessity of introducing
colour distinction directly or indirectly. A real and reasonable
educational test would perhaps for ever put a stop to the danger (if
ever there be any) of the Indian vote swamping the European, and
would, so far as possible, keep the Roll clear of the most objectionable
European  voters also, if any.
“G.W.W*” takes exception to the arguments drawn from the
relative strength of the true votes and “calls attention to what the next
year’s  Roll may contain”. I beg to call his attention to the fact that,
although the Indians had every opportunity to “swamp” the List last
year and the year before last, and every incentive to do so because of
the fear as to the result of the Franchise Act, now about to be repealed,
there were no additions to the number of Indian voters. It must have
been either extraordinary apathy or want of qualifications that could
account for such a result, But it could not have been any such apathy,
for the “Agitation” has been on foot for the last two years.
I, however, do not propose to examine “G.W.W*”’s letter in
detail, for want of time and space, and will merely give the
information he asks for, and apply it to the new Bill to be introduced
during the forthcoming session.

New Para:  The object of the Bill, which it is my duty to expound to the House is
to widen the basis and extend the function of the Government of India, to give
further opportunity than at present exists to the non-official and the native
element in Indian society to take part in the work of government and in this
way to lend official recognition to that remarkable development, both in
political industry and political  capacity, which has been visible among the
higher classes of Indian society since the Government of India was taken over
by the Crown in 1858* This Bill is one to amend the Indian Councils Act of
1861* Legislative powers of some sort or other, but powers of a somewhat
confused character and conflicting validity, have existed in India for a very
long time. They existed with the rule of the old East India Company dating
from the date of the Charters of the Tudor and Stuart Sovereigns; but the
modern legislative system, under which India at present exists, owns its
origin to the viceroyalty of Lord Canning and to the Secretaryship of State of
Sir C* Wood, who was afterwards elevated to the peerage. Sir C* Wood, in
1861, carried through the House the India Councils Act of the year. . . . The
Act of 1861 constituted three Legislative Councils in India—the Supreme
Council of the Viceroy and the Provincial Councils of Madras and Bombay.
The Supreme Legislative Council of the Viceroy consists of the Governor-
General and his Executive Council, and is recruited by a minimum of six and a
maximum of twelve additional members who are nominated by the Governor-
General, of  whom at least half must be non-official, whether they are drawn
from the European or the native element. The Legislative Councils of Madras
and Bombay are also recruited by a minimum of four and a maximum of eight
additional members, who are nominated by the Provincial Governor, of whom
at least half must be non-official. Since the passing of that Act, Legislative
Councils have also been called into existence in Bengal and the North-West
Provinces. In the case of Bengal, the Council consists of the Lieutenant-
Governor and twelve nominated Councillors and, in the case of the North-West
Provinces, of the Lieutenant-Governor and  nine nominated councillors, of
whom one-third in each case must be non-official. . . . A number  of native
gentlemen of intelligence and capacity and public spirit have been persuaded
to come forward and to lend their services to the function of government, and
undoubtedly the standard of merit of these Legislative Councils has stood
high.
The Amending Act gives the right to discuss the Budget and the
right of interpellation (rights hitherto not enjoyed). It also increases
the number of members of the Council, and provides (vaguely) for a
system of election. Of course, the Act is merely permissive.
According to the regulations issued under the above Act, out of
eighteen seats for additional members for the Bombay Council, eight
seats are filled by election. And the Corporation of Bombay (itself a

the Colony.
In the Memorial
1 that was presented to this Honourable House
on behalf of the Indian community on the same subject when the Act
25 of 1894 was under consideration, it was contended that the Indians
did possess elective representative institutions in India.
The present Bill disfranchises natives of countries, not being of
European origin, which have not possessed elective representative
institutions in their own native land.
The position of your Memorialists, therefore, is painfully
awkward in opposing the present Bill.

franchise, your Memorialists consider it to be their duty respectfully
to express their views about the Bill and also to show further on what
grounds they believe  that the Indians possess elective representative
institutions in India.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 328, 2, 9, 747493) It embodies the elective principle.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 328, 2, 10, 747529) The Legislative Councils have from their inception enjoyed the representative character.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 328, 2, 11, 747618) The honourable mover of the second reading, with reference to the increase of nominated members, said:
New Para:  The object of this addition is very easily stated and will, I think, be very
easily understood by the House. It is simply by expanding the area of
selection, in which case you are adding to the strength of the representative
character of the Councils.
But  now these Councils, your Memorialists venture to submit,
enjoy the representative character “founded on the franchise”.
Speaking on an Amendment by Mr* Schwann, M.P*, to the Bill
to the effect that “no reform of Councils that does not embody the
elective principle will be satisfactory”, Mr* Curzon said:

New Para:  I should like to point to him that our Bill does not necessarily exclude
some such principle as the method of selection, election or delegation. With
the permission of the House, I will read the words of the sub- section  of Clause
I* It runs as follows: The Governor-General-in-Council may from time to  time
on the approval of the Secretary of State-in-Council make regulations as to the
conditions under which such nominations or any of them shall be made by the
Governor-General, Governors and Lieutenant-Governors, respectively, and
prescribe the manner in which such regulations shall be carried into  effect. . .
.”
Lord Kimberley
1 has expressed himself about that clause. He
said:
I am bound to say that I express my whole satisfaction with regard to this
elective principle.
The opinions expressed by Lord Kimberley are shared by the
Secretary of State under this Act:
It would be in the power of the Viceroy to invite representative bodies in
India to elect or select or delegate representatives of those bodies of their
opinion to be nominated to these Councils and by elective measures
The Right Honourable Mr* Gladstone, speaking on the same
subject, after explaining the speeches of the honourable mover of the
Second Reading of the Bill and its amendment, said:

New Para:  I think I may fairly say that the speech of the Under-Secretary appears to
me to embody the elective principle in the only sense in which we should
expect it to be embodied. . . It is evident that the great question—and it is one
of great and profound interest—before the House is that of the introduction of
the elective element into the Government of India. What I wish is that their
first steps shall be of a genuine nature and that whatever scope they give to the
elective principle shall be real; there  is no difference of principle. I think that
the acceptance of the elective principle by the honourable gentleman (Mr*
Curzon) though guarded was not otherwise than a frank acceptance.
Turning to the Regulations made and published in accordance

New Para:  Her Majesty’s Government ought to understand that it will  be regarded
as a most grave disappointment if, after all the assurances we have received
that an attempt will be made to bring into operation this powerful engine of
Government (i.e., the elective principle), there should not be some result such
as we anticipate from their action. I do not speak of its amount, I speak more
of its quality. In an Asiatic country like India, with its ancient civilization,
with its institutions so peculiar, with such a diversity of races, religions and
pursuits, with such an enormous extent of  country, and such a multitude of
human beings as probably except in China were never before under a single
Government, I can understand that there should be difficulties in carrying out
what we desire to see accomplished. But great as the difficulties are the task is
a noble one, and will require the utmost prudence and care in conducting it to a
successful consummation. All these things induce us to look forward
cheerfully to a great future for India, and to expect that a real success will
attend the genuine application, even though it may be a limited one, of the
elective principle to the government of that vast and almost immeasurable
country.
The opinion of those who are qualified to speak on Indian
subjects seems to be unanimous as to the representative character of
the Indian Councils.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 331, 1, 2, 753756) Sir William Wilson Hunter, the greatest living authority on Indian subjects, says:
New Para:  The representative principle is now being cautiously extended, under Lord
Cross’s Act of 1892, to the Legislative Councils both of the Supreme and the
Provincial Governments.
The Times, dealing with the Indian franchise in Natal, says:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 331, 2, 3, 753839) The representative principle is now being cautiously extended, under Lord Cross’s Act of 1892, to the Legislative Councils both of the Supreme and the Provincial Governments.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 331, 2, 4, 754014) The Times, dealing with the Indian franchise in Natal, says:
New Para:  The argument that the Indian in Natal cannot claim higher privileges than
he enjoys in India and that he has no franchise whatever in India is
inconsistent with the facts. The Indian has precisely the same franchise in
India which the Englishman enjoys.
After dealing with the Municipal franchise the article goes on to
say:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 331, 3, 5, 754075) The argument that the Indian in Natal cannot claim higher privileges than he enjoys in India and that he has no franchise whatever in India is inconsistent with the facts.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 331, 3, 6, 754247) The Indian has precisely the same franchise in India which the Englishman enjoys.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 331, 3, 7, 754329) After dealing with the Municipal franchise the article goes on to say:
New Para:  A similar principle applies, with the modification incidental to our system
of  government in India, to what may be called the Higher Electorate. The
elected members of the Supreme and the Legislative Councils, which deal with
221 millions of British subjects are mainly elected by native bodies. Apart
from the official representatives of Government in the Supreme and Provincial
Legislatures about one-half the members are natives. It would be wrong to
push this analogy too far. But it answers the argument against allowing
British Indian subjects a vote in British Colonies on the ground that they have
no vote in India. So far as government by voting exists in India, Englishmen
and Indians stand on the same footing and, like in the Municipal, the
Provincial and the Supreme Councils, the native interests are powerfully
represented.
The Municipal franchise is very broad in India, and almost the
whole of British India is studded by Municipal Corporations and
Local Boards.
Speaking of the class of Indians already on the Voters’ Rolls in
Natal, The Times article, referred to above, says:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 331, 4, 8, 754400) A similar principle applies, with the modification incidental to our system of government in India, to what may be called the Higher Electorate.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 331, 4, 15, 755380) Speaking of the class of Indians already on the Voters’ Rolls in Natal, The Times article, referred to above, says:
New Para:  It is precisely this class of men who form the most valued element in the
municipal and other electorates in India. Throughout the 750 municipalities of
India the British and the native voters have equal rights, and 9,790 Municipal
Commissioners (Councillors) in 1891 were natives as against 839 Europeans.
The European vote on the Indian Municipal Boards was therefore only one to 8
Indian votes, while in the Natal Electorate there are 37 European votes to one
British Indian. . . . It must be remembered that Indian Municipalities
administer a population of 15 millions and an expenditure of 50 million
rupees.
As to the acquaintance of the Indian with the nature and
responsibilities of representative  institutions, the same article says:

New Para:  There is probably no other country in the world in which representative
institutions have penetrated so deeply into the life of the people. Every caste,
every trade, every village in India had for ages its council of five which
practically legislated for and conducted the administration of the little
community which it represented. Until the introduction of the Parish
Councils’ Act last year, there was no such rural  system of self-administration
even in England.
Mr* Schwann., M.P*, on the same subject says:
Do not suppose that the question of election is a new one in India. . . .
There is no question which is more specially Indian than the question of
election. Most of our civilization has come from India. And there is not the
slightest doubt that we ourselves are practising a development of the Eastern
principle of election.
Under such circumstances the Indian community whom the Bill
is intended to affect find it most difficult to understand it.
Your Memorialists submit that the vagueness and ambiguity of
the Bill are very undesirable and fair neither to the European
community nor the Indian. They leave both in a state of suspense
which is painful to the latter.
Your Memorialists respectfully draw the attention of this
Honourable House to the fact that according to the present  Voters’
Roll, there is one Indian to every 38 Europeans, and that the Indian
voters belong  to  the  most respectable element in that  community
and are residents of long standing with large stakes in the Colony.
It is said, however, that the present List is no guide to what
proportions the Indian vote may assume in future. But the fact that,
during the two years that the disfranchisement of the Indian
community has been threatened, no more Indians have had their
names placed on the Voters’ Roll, in your Memorialists’ humble
opinion, sufficiently disposes of the argument.
The truth is, and your Memorialists venture to speak from
personal experience, there are not very many Indians in the Colony
who have got the legal property qualification, low as it is.
Your Memorialists respectfully submit that the Bill under
discussion is open to more objections than one. In your Memorialists’
humble opinion, it introduces the colour distinction in a most
invidious manner. For, while natives of  other countries not enjoying
elective representative institutions may not become voters, natives of
the States of Europe, even though they may not enjoy such
institutions in the  countries they come from, may become voters
under the General Franchise Law of the Colony.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 332, 1, 2, 756269) There is probably no other country in the world in which representative institutions have penetrated so deeply into the life of the people.

334

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 333, 0, 1, 758823) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 334
New Para:  It would make the sons of non-European women 
of
questionable reputation eligible as voters so long as the father is a
European, while it would prevent the son of a European lady of noble
birth, should she choose to marry a nobleman belonging to a non-
European race, from becoming a voter under the General Franchise
Law of the Colony.
Assuming that the Indians come under the scope of the Bill, the
method by which they may get themselves placed on the Voters’ Roll
will be a source of constant irritation to the Indian community, and
may give rise to a system of favouritism and cause serious dissensions
among the members of the Indian community.
The Bill is moreover calculated to involve the Indian community
in endless litigation in order to enable them to vindicate their rights,
which your Memorialists think, are capable of definition without any
recourse to the law-courts of the Colony.
Above all, it will transfer the agitation from the hands of the
Europeans, who now wish to see the Indians disfranchised, into those
of the Indian community. And the agitation, your Memorialists fear,
has to be perpetual.
It is most humbly submitted that such a state of things is very
undesirable in the interests of all the communities inhabiting this
Colony.
Your Memorialists, after a careful investigation for over a year,
have ventured to come to the conclusion that the fear about the Indian
vote swamping the European is absolutely imaginary, and, therefore,
fervently pray and venture to hope that this Honourable House, before
assenting to any Bill specially restrictive of the Indian vote or directly
or indirectly introducing any colour distinction, would institute an
inquiry into the real state of affairs which would show how many
resident Indians there are in this Colony who possess the legal
property qualification necessary for being placed on the Voters’
Roll.And for this act of justice and mercy, your Memorialists, as in
duty bound, shall for ever pray, etc., etc.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 333, 1, 2, 758865) It would make the sons of non-European women of questionable reputation eligible as voters so long as the father is a European, while it would prevent the son of a European lady of noble birth, should she choose to marry a nobleman belonging to a non- European race, from becoming a voter under the General Franchise Law of the Colony.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 333, 1, 3, 759201) Assuming that the Indians come under the scope of the Bill, the method by which they may get themselves placed on the Voters’ Roll will be a source of constant irritation to the Indian community, and may give rise to a system of favouritism and cause serious dissensions among the members of the Indian community.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 333, 1, 4, 759515) The Bill is moreover calculated to involve the Indian community in endless litigation in order to enable them to vindicate their rights, which your Memorialists think, are capable of definition without any recourse to the law-courts of the Colony.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 333, 1, 5, 759763) Above all, it will transfer the agitation from the hands of the Europeans, who now wish to see the Indians disfranchised, into those of the Indian community.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 333, 1, 6, 759921) And the agitation, your Memorialists fear, has to be perpetual.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 333, 1, 7, 759985) It is most humbly submitted that such a state of things is very undesirable in the interests of all the communities inhabiting this Colony.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 333, 1, 8, 760125) Your Memorialists, after a careful investigation for over a year, have ventured to come to the conclusion that the fear about the Indian vote swamping the European is absolutely imaginary, and, therefore, fervently pray and venture to hope that this Honourable House, before assenting to any Bill specially restrictive of the Indian vote or directly or indirectly introducing any colour distinction, would institute an inquiry into the real state of affairs which would show how many resident Indians there are in this Colony who possess the legal property qualification necessary for being placed on the Voters’ Roll.And for this act of justice and mercy, your Memorialists, as in duty bound, shall for ever pray, etc., etc.

New Para:  The Indian community earnestly request you not to accept Natal Franchise
Bill or Ministerial alteration thereof proposed last night; memorial preparing.
In Committee, however, the Honourable Sir John Robinson
announced on the 11th day of May, 1896, that Your Honour had
agreed to a further addition viz, ‘Parliamentary’ between ‘the’ and
‘franchise’.
The Bill, therefore, as  to representative institutions would now
read 
“elective 
representative 
institutions 
founded 
on 
the
Parliamentary franchise”.
Your Memorialists humbly venture to think that the present Bill,
so far as the Indian community and, indeed, all the communities are
concerned, is worse than the Act it repeals.
Your Memorialists, therefore, feel aggrieved that you have been
pleased to approve of the Bill, but they trust that the facts and
arguments placed before you hereinbelow are such as would induce
you to reconsider your views.
Your Memorialists have all along contended that the Indians did
enjoy “elective representative institutions” in India. But the papers
published in connection with the franchise question seem to show that
you do not think that the Indians possess such institutions. With the
greatest deference to Your Honour’s view, your Memorialists crave
leave to draw your attention to the extracts quoted in the annexure
‘A’ upholding the opposite view.
Your approval of the present Bill, coupled with the view held by
Your Honour regarding “elective representative institutions” in India,
places the Indian community in Natal in a very painful and awkward
position. Your Memorialists venture to submit:

2* That, if there be any doubt with regard to this point, an
enquiry should be first instituted  as to whether such a necessity does
exist.
3* That, assuming that the necessity exists, the present Bill is not
calculated to meet the difficulty in a straightforward and open
manner.
4* That, if her Majesty’s Government are absolutely satisfied
that the necessity exists and that no Bill could be conceived that would
solve the difficulty without a resort to class legislation, it is better that
in any Franchise Bill the Indians should be specially named.
5* That the present Bill is likely to give rise to endless litigation
owing to its ambiguity and vagueness.
6* That it would involve the Indian community in expenses
almost beyond their control.
7* That assuming the Bill affects the Indian community, the
method provided in the Bill whereby any member thereof may be
exempted from its operation  is, your Memorialists respectfully
submit,arbitrary, unfair, and likely to create dissensions among the
members of the Indian community.
8* That the Bill, like the Act repealed, makes an invidious
distinction  between Europeans and others.
Your Memorialists humbly submit that the present condition of
the Voters’ List in Natal renders it absolutely unnecessary to embark
on any legislation to restrict the Indian franchise. There seems to be
needless hurry about passing a measure that affects a large portion of
Her Majesty’s subjects. It is admitted that as against 9,309 European
voters there are only 251 Indian voters; 201 are either traders or
clerks, assistants, schoolmasters, etc., and 50 are gardeners and others,
and that most of these voters are settlers of long standing. These
figures, your Memorialists submit, do not warrant any restrictive
legislation. The Bill under discussion is intended to deal with a remote
and probable and possible danger. A danger is really assumed which
does not  exist. His Honour, Sir John Robinson, in moving the second
reading of the Bill, based his fears about the danger of the European
vote being swamped by the Indian vote on three grounds, viz.:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 339, 1, 2, 771576) 1. That no legislation restrictive of the Indian franchise in Natal is necessary.

New Para:  1* The fact that the petition to Her Majesty’s Government in
connection with the Franchise Act, repealed  by the present Bill, was
signed by nearly 9,000 Indians.
2* The approaching general election in the Colony.
3* The existence of the Natal Indian Congress.
As to the first ground, even in the correspondence on the
subject, the Natal Government have  argued that the 9,000 signatories
wanted to be placed on the Voters’ Roll. The first paragraph of that
petition is a sufficient answer to the argument. The Petitioners, your
Memorialists humbly submit, never contended for any such thing.
They certainly protested against the wholesale disfranchisement of the
Indians. Your Memorialists humbly venture to think that every Indian,
whether he had the property qualifications or not, was very materially
affected by that Bill. Your Memorialists admit that the fact show a
degree of organizing power among the Indians, alluded to by the
Hon. mover, but your Memorialists respectfully contend that no
matter how powerful the organizing power might be, it cannot
overcome the  natural barriers. Out of the 9,000 signatories, not a
hundred, besides those who were already on the Voters’ Roll,
possessed the legal property qualifications.
With regard to the second ground, the Hon. mover said:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 340, 1, 14, 775065) mover said:
New Para:  He  might remind members that before long there must be a general
election, and they would have to consider upon what register that general
election was to take place. It was not for him to say how many Indian electors
might or might not be on the ensuing electoral roll, but the Government
thought it was high time that no further delay should take place in seizing this
question by the throat and setting it once for all, without further delay.
Your Memorialists submit, with all due respect to the Hon.
mover, that all these fears have no foundation in fact. According to
the Report of the Protector of Immigrants for 1895, out of 46,343
Indians in the Colony, only 30,303 are free Indians. To that may be
added the trading Indian population of, say, 5,000* Thus there are
only 35,000 Indians, as against over 45,000 Europeans, who can at all
compete with the  latter. The 16,000 indentured Indians, it is easy to
see, never can vote, while they are under indenture. But a large
majority of the 30,303 are only a stage higher than the indentured
Indians. And your Memorialists venture to say from personal
experience that there are in this Colony thousands of Indians who do
not pay £10 per year in rents. In fact, there are thousands who have to

New Para:  Members might not be aware that there was in this country a body, a
very powerful body in its way, a very united body, though practically a secret
body—he meant the Indian Congress. That was a body which possessed  large
funds, it was a body presided over by very active and very able men, and it was
a body the avowed  object of which was to exercise strong political power in
the affairs of the Colony.
Your Memorialists venture to say that this estimate of the
Congress is not justified by facts. The charge of secrecy, as would
appear from the correspondence between the Honourable the Prime
Minister of Natal and the Honorary Secretary of the Congress, was
made under an erroneous impression (Appendices B,C, D

statement with  regard to the matter also was made by him in the
Legislative Assembly on the 20th instant.
Nor has the Congress in any shape or form intended or
attempted to “exercise strong political power”. The following are the
objects of the Congress, which were published in almost every paper
in South Africa last year:
“1* To bring about a better understanding and promote
friendliness between the Europeans and the Indians residing in the
Colony.
“2* To spread information about India and the Indians by

It would thus appear that the object of the Congress is to resist
degradation, not to gain political power. As to funds the Congress has
a property worth £1,080 and a balance of £148-7s 8d in the Bank, at
the time of writing this. These funds have to be used in charity,
printing memorials and working expenses. In your Memorialists’
humble opinion they are hardly sufficient to fulfil the objects of the
Congress. The educational work is greatly hampered owing to want of
funds. Your Memorialists, therefore, venture to submit that the danger
which the present Bill is intended to guard against does not exist at all.
Your Memorialists, however, do not request Her Majesty’s
Government to accept the above facts as correct on their ipse dixit. If
there is any doubt about any of them—and the most important fact is
that there are thousands who do not possess the necessary property
qualifications for becoming voters—then the proper course, your
Memorialists submit, is to enquire about them, particularly to enquire
how many Indians there are in the Colony who possess immovable
property of the value of  £50 or who pay a yearly rent of £10* To
prepare such a return would neither cost much time nor much money,
and would be a very material help towards a satisfactory solution of
the franchise question. The hot haste to pass  some measure is, in your
Memorialists humble opinion, detrimental to the best interests of the
Colony as a whole. Your Memorialists, so far as they, as
representatives of the Indian community, are concerned and speaking
authoritatively for the organization of which they have the honour to
be members, hereby beg to assure Her Majesty’s Government that
they have no intention to endeavour to place a single Indian voter on
the Voters’ List for the general election next year.
The Government organ, dealing with the present Bill in a

New Para:  Moreover, we feel sure that should the Asiatic vote ever endanger the
stability of European rule in this Colony, the Imperial Government will find
ways and means out of such a difficulty. The new Bill imposes certain
limitations on the acquirement of the franchise by all who are not of European
origin, and as now even with the franchise open to British subjects of all races
and classes, except the Natives under Native law, there are only some 250
Indians on the Voters’ Roll out of a total of 9,560 registered voters, or in the
proportion of one Indian voter to every 38 Europeans in possession of the
franchise, we think the new Bill will fully meet the requirements of the case for
very many long years at all events, if not for all time. In South Carolina, for
instance, the Negroes over 21 years old number 132,949, while the whites
over 21 only number 102,567, yet the whites have retained the dominant
power, although in the minority. The fact of the matter is that apart from
numbers altogether the superior race will always hold the reins of
Government. We are inclined to the belief, therefore, that the danger of the
Indian vote swamping the European is a chimerical one. From what we know
of the matter, we are inclined to think that it will be held that India is a country
possessing “Elective representative institutions”. In fact, the argument so
often advanced that the Indian is unacquainted with their nature and
responsibilities is really wide off the mark, as in India there are some 750
municipalities in which British and native voters have equal rights, and in
1891, there were 9,790 native municipal commissioners (councillors) as
against 839 Europeans. . . .Even assuming, however, that natives of India will
be held as coming from a country possessing “elective representative
institutions”, we do not consider that the danger of being swamped is at all a
likely one, as past experience has proved that the class of Indians coming
here, as a rule, do not concern themselves about the franchise, and further, the
majority of them do not even possess the small property qualification
required. In addition to all this, the obligations of the Empire of which we
form a part do not permit of Indians as Indians being excluded from the
exercise of such a privilege as the franchise. So far as we are concerned,
therefore, such attitude is a non possumus and may, therefore, be dropped.
Should the restrictions of the  new law not prevent the introduction of an
undesirable element onto the Voters’ Roll, there is nothing at all to prevent us
raising the franchise qualification. At present it is very low. The property
qualification could, therefore, be easily increased, even doubled and an
educational test imposed which, while it would not remove a single European
from the Voters’ Roll, would have a sweeping effect on Indian voters. The
number of the later possessing immovable property of the value of say, £100
or paying a rent of £20 per annum and able to read and write English must be
exceedingly small, and should this fail, there would be nothing to hinder us
from adopting the Mississippi plan, or a modification of it to suit the
circumstances (5th March, 1896).

With these qualifications there is evidently no trouble in

class as the Indians in Natal. Only, there they are far more prosperous
than their Natal brethren.
Assuming, however, that the necessity to deal with the Indian
franchise does exist, your Memorialists respectfully beg to say that the
present Bill is not calculated to meet it in a straightforward and open
manner. The Honourable and learned Attorney-General of Natal,

New Para:  . . . What is the present Bill if not a side-wind? Its whole object is to
endeavour quietly and by a side-wind to effect that which the measure of last
session failed to accomplish. Mr* Escombe admitted that the measure was
brutally blunt and to this he rightly ascribed its failure to obtain acceptance by
the Imperial Government. He further admitted that the present Bill has
precisely the same object in view as the “brutal” Bill, only it does not state its
object honestly and straightforwardly; in other words, it seeks quietly and by a
side-wind to reach the goal apparently unattainable by plain sailing.
If Her Majesty’s Government are convinced that a real necessity
exists for legislation restricting the Indian franchise in Natal, and if
Her Majesty’s Government are satisfied that the question cannot be
dealt with but by class legislation, and if Her Majesty’s Government
further accept the Colonial view that Indian British subjects, in spite of
the gracious Proclamation of 1858, may be treated on a different
footing from that on which the European British subjects are treated,
then, your Memorialists submit that it would be infinitely better and
more satisfactory to exclude the Indians by name from any rights and
privileges that they in the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government,
should not be allowed to enjoy, than that by ambiguous legislation the
door should be left open for litigation and trouble.
That the Bill, if assented to, would give rise to endless litigation
owing to its ambiguity is an admitted fact. It is admittedly also of the
first importance that the question of the Indian franchise should be
“settled once for all”. to quote the words of the Honourable the
Prime Minister of Natal. And yet, in the opinion of the majority of the
leaders of opinion in Natal, the Bill will not settle the question once
for all.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 347, 2, 9, 792663) It would also have the further effect of inducing appeals to the Privy Council and would prejudice the election of members to this House.

New Para:  Our warning that, if the Bill passes into law as it stands, the Colony
will be involved in serious litigation, had the support of Mr* Binns and Mr*
Bale, and Mr* Smythe’s half loaf, which is better than, nothing, would be
dearly purchased at that price. What leads us to  think the Bill has not been
considered by the legal advisers of the Crown are the exceedingly delicate
questions which it raises and which will undoubtedly be fought out unless
the wording be altered so as not to leave the possibility of a resort to law.
Amongst these questions are the following: Can a Colony make laws which
contravene the Naturalization Law of England? Are British Indians British
subjects or not? In other words the Bill raises the whole question of the
position of the British Indians in the Empire. Can special laws be passed in
Natal, since the issue of the Proclamation of 1858, [to] take away any part
of the privileges conferred by that document?
After deploring the ambiguity and vagueness of the Bill, The
Natal Advertiser, in its leader of the 8th May, says:

New Para:  formidable objection to the principle of the clause. It is not so much
the number of Indian voters that the Indian community wish to see on
the Voters’ Roll as the vindication of their rights and privileges as
British subjects and the equal status with European British subjects
that is assured to the British Indians by Her Most Gracious Majesty the
Queen Empress on more occasions than one, and that has been
specially assured to the Indian community in Natal by Her Majesty’s
Government in a special despatch by the Right Honourable the late
Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies. If other British subjects
having certain qualifications can claim the franchise as of right, why,
your Memorialists humbly ask, should  not the Indian British
subjects?
The method is cumbrous and will tend to keep up the franchise
agitation for ever. It would, moreover, transfer the agitation from the
Europeans to the Indians. The speeches in the Assembly on the
second reading show that the power will be exercised very sparingly, if
at all, by the Governor-in-Council.
It is calculated to create dissensions among the Indian
community, for the applicant who is rejected may resent the favour
granted to  a brother applicant if the one considers himself as good as
the other.
Education, intelligence, and stake, are mentioned in Your
Honour’s despatch relating to the franchise question as entitling the
Indians to the franchise. Your Memorialists submit that if a certain
amount of education, intelligence or stake is to be sufficient to qualify
an Indian to become a voter in the Colony, then such a test could be
introduced instead of leaving the  power in the hands of the
Governor-in-Council. Hereon, your Memorialists beg to draw your
attention to a portion of the leading article in The Natal Mercury
hereinbefore quoted. If the necessary qualifications for those coming
under the operation of that Bill were stated, it would do  away with the
contentious character of that part of  the Bill, and those coming under
its operation will  then know exactly what qualifications would entitle
them to a vote. The position is well summed up in The Natal

by the introduction of Indian electors.” Further on he said, “There would be no
other voice throughout South Africa than that the electoral rolls of the country
should be absolutely confined to persons of the European race. That was the
starting point from which they began and the goal they had in view all along.”

side-wind, if the phrase is more expressive, in inserting a provision in a
measure, which its framers declare in submitting it for adoption, they mean to

It would be hardly pleasant for a wealthy Indian merchant to
have to apply for a permit to be exempted from the operation of the

New Para:  If the Indians are allowed to carry with them their status as British
subjects to foreign countries and British Colonies whither they go in quest of
work, the opening up of Africa holds out new possibilities to Indian labour.
The Indian Government and the Indians themselves believe that it is in South
Africa that this question of their status must be determined. If they secure the
position of British subjects in South Africa, it will be almost impossible to
deny it to them elsewhere. If they fail to secure that position in South Africa it
will be extremely difficult for them to attain it elsewhere. They readily
acknowledge that Indian labourers who accept a contract of service for a period
of years, as the price of aided immigration, must fulfil the conditions of their
contract, however it may curtail their rights. But they hold that after the period
of contracted labour has expired, they are entitled to the status  of British
subjects in whatever Colony or country they have fixed their abodes.... The
Indian Government may reasonably ask that after Indian labourers have given
their best years to South Africa they should not be forced back upon India by
denying to them the status of British subjects in their adopted homes.
Whatever the decision may be, it will seriously affect the future development
of emigration in India.

New Para:  According to this return, there are in the Colony 9,309 European
registered voters against 251 registered voters of British Indian origin. . . .
Nor, if Mr* Gandhi’s statements are correct, does it seem possible that the
Indian vote can swamp the European at any period within the range of practical
politics. . . . Not only are  all Indian immigrants under labour contracts
excluded but also all British Indians whatsoever, except an extremely small
class, who, by intelligence and industry, have raised themselves to the
position of well-to-do citizens. . . .
The returns  show that even under the existing law it takes a long time
for a British Indian to attain the franchise in Natal. With the exception of 63
British Indians,  many of whom started with capital, and whose residence in
the Colony is under ten years, the rest of the 251 voters seem to have resided
during more than 10 years and the majority over 14* An analysis of the British
Indian Voters’ List according to occupation yields equally encouraging results
to those who wish to see this question settled. . . .
It is precisely this class of men who form the most valued element in the
municipal and other electorates in India. The argument that the Indian in Natal
cannot claim higher privileges than he enjoys in India and that he has no
franchise whatever in India is inconsistent with the facts. . . . So  far as
government by voting exists in India, Englishmen and Indians stand on the
same footing, and alike in the Municipal, the Provincial, and the Supreme
Councils the native interests are powerfully represented. Nor does the plea that
the British Indian is unacquainted with the nature and responsibilities of
representative government beat inspection. There is probably no other
country in the world in which representative institutions have penetrated so
deeply into the life of the people. . . .
The question now before Mr* Chamberlain is not an academic one. It is
not a question of argument but of racefeeling. The Queen’s Proclamation of
1858 gave the full rights of British subjects to the Indians and they vote in
England and sit  in the British Parliament on the same terms as Englishmen.
But these questions are inevitable in a vast Empire made up of  many peoples
and as the steamship brings the component population of Greater Britain into
closer contact they will present themselves in more acute forms. Two things
are clear. Such questions will not settle themselves by being ignored, and a
strong Government at home affords the best Court of Appeal to adjudicate
upon them.  We cannot afford a war of races among our own subjects.  It would

There is a balance in hand of £194, and it possesses, besides, a

not put forward more than 200 more in its best efforts. The end of its
ambition, as I said, is an equal status with the Europeans, and we don’t
object to any qualification that may be required. We are even willing

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 356, 2, 5, 815802) What is the number of Indian voters in the Colony?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 356, 2, 6, 815853) There are only 251 on the Voters’ Roll, as against 9,309 Europeans.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 356, 2, 7, 815921) Of the former 143 are in Durban, and the Congress could not put forward more than 200 more in its best efforts.

New Para:  What will your future programme be?
What it has always been. The Congress will continue to ventilate
the grievances of the Indian community by the publication of
literature throughout the Colony, in India and England, and to write to
the newspapers on any Indian questions as they come prominently
before  the public, and to collect funds for its propaganda. Hitherto
the Congress has not invited the Press to any of its meetings, but it has
now been decided to do this occasionally, and furnish it with
information  concerning its efforts. The Congress first wished to be
assured of a permanent existence before it invited the Press to its
meetings. There is one matter I would like to correct. The address
presented to me stated that the various objects of the Congress had
been fulfilled. That was not so. They were under consideration, and
the Congress would continue to work for their attainment by every
legitimate means, and it will resist any attempt  to introduce colour
distinctions in the legislation  for the Indian community; for these, if
introduced, might be used in other Colonies, and other parts of the
world.

SOUTH AFRICA : AN APPEAL TO THE INDIAN PUBLIC
1

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 358, 1, 2, 818987) 101. THE GRIEVANCES OF THE BRITISH INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA : AN APPEAL TO THE INDIAN PUBLIC 1
New Para:  RAJKOT, KATHIAWAR,
August 14, 1896
This is an appeal to the Indian public on behalf of the 100,000
Indians in South Africa. I have been commissioned by the leading
members representing that community in South Africa to lay before
the public in India the grievances that her Majesty’s Indian subjects
are labouring  under in that country.
South Africa is a continent by itself and is divided into many
States of which the Colonies of Natal and the Cape of Good Hope,
Zululand, a Crown Colony, the South African Republic of the
Transvaal, Orange Free State and the Chartered Territories, are
inhabited, more or less, by the Indians together with the Europeans
and the natives of those countries. The Portuguese territories, viz.,
Delagoa Bay, Beira and Mozambique, have a large Indian population,
but there the Indians have no grievances, apart from the general
population.
NATAL
From an Indian standpoint, Natal is the most important portion
of South Africa. It has a native population of about 400,000, a
European population of nearly 50,000 and an Indian population of
about 51,000, of whom about 16,000 are those at present serving their
indenture, about 30,000 are those who, having once been under
indenture, are freed therefrom and have settled in the Colony on their
own account, and about 5,000 belong to the trading community.
These latter, of course, came to the Colony on their own means and
some of them brought capital also into the country. The indentured
Indians are drawn from the labouring population of Madras and
Calcutta and are nearly equally divided. Those from Madras speak, as
a rule, the Tamil language, and those from Calcutta, the Hindi. Most
of them are Hindus, a good few are Mahomedans. Strictly speaking,
they do not observe caste restrictions. After becoming free, they either
take to gardening or hawking vegetables and earn from 2 to 3 pounds

New Para:  sterling per month. A few become petty storekeepers. That business,
however, is practically in the hands of the 5,000 Indians, who are
drawn chiefly from the Mahomedan community in the Bombay
Presidency. Some of these latter are doing well. Many are large
landowners, two are now shipowners also. One of them has a small oil
machine worked by steam. They come either from Surat, or districts
surrounding Bombay, or Porbandar. Many merchants from Surat
have settled in Durban with their families. Most of them, including the
assisted immigrants, can read and write their own language to a greater
extent than one would think they do.

1 to

of Natal to show what treatment the Indian receives at the hands of the

New Para:  The man in the street hates him, curses him, spits upon him, and often
pushes him off the foot-path. The Press cannot find a sufficiently strong word
in the best English dictionary to damn him with. Here are a few samples. “The
real canker that is eating into the very vitals of the community”, “these
parasites”, “wily, wretched semi-barbarous Asiatics”, “A thing black and lean
and a long way from clean, which they call the accursed Hindoo”, “He is
chock-full of vice and he lives upon rice. I heartily cuss the Hindoo”, “Squalid
coolies with truthless tongues and artful ways”. The Press almost
unanimously refuses to call the Indian by his proper name. He is
“Ramysamy”. He is “Mr* Samy”.
2 He is “Mr* Coolie”. He is “the black man”.
And these offensive epithets have become so common that they (at any rate,
one of them, “Coolie”) are used even in the sacred precincts of the courts, as if
“the Coolie” were the legal and proper name to give to any and every Indian.
The public men, too, seem to use the word freely. I have often heard the
painful expression “coolie clerk” from the mouths of men who ought to know
better.
3 The tramcars are not for the Indians. The railway officials may treat
the Indians as beasts, No matter how clean, his very sight is such an offence
to every White man in the Colony that he would object to sit, even for a short
time, in the same compartment with the  Indian. The hotels shut their doors
against them.
4 Even the public baths are not for the Indians no matter who
they are. . . . The vagrant law is needlessly oppressive and often puts
respectable Indians in a very awkward position.

New Para:  I have quoted this because the statement has been before the
South African public for nearly one year and a half, has been
commented upon freely by almost every newspaper in South Africa
and remains practically uncontradicted (indeed, it has even been
endorsed by one newspaper with approval) and because, during the
interval that has elapsed, I have seen nothing to change that view. The
Right Honourable Mr* Chamberlain
1, however, while in full sympathy
with its object, in his reply to the deputation headed by the Hon’ble
Mr* Dadabhai
2 is  said to have stated that our grievances were more
sentimental than material and real and that, if he could be shown any
instances of real grievance, he should deal with them effectively. The
Times of India, which has done us much service and has laid us under
deep obligation to it by its persistent advocacy on our behalf, rebuked
Mr* Chamberlain for calling our grievances sentimental. To give,
however, proof of real grievances and to strengthen the position of the
advocates of our cause in India, I shall beg leave to cite my own
testimony and that of those who have undergone grievances
personally. Every word of every statement to be made immediately
can be established beyond the shadow of a doubt.
In Dundee last year, during the Christmas time, a gang of White
men set fire to the Indian stores without the slightest provocation, in
order to enjoy themselves. Mr* Abdulla Haji Adam, a shipowner and
one of the leading members of the Indian community in South Africa,
was travelling with me as far as Krantzkloof Station. He alighted there

Rustomjee pays his rates just as well as the other ratepayers. In Field
Street, Durban, last year during Christmas time, some youths threw
burning crackers in the Indian stores doing some damage. Three
months ago, in the same street, some youths shot lead bullets into an
Indian store with a sling, hurting a customer who nearly lost his eye.
Both these matters were brought to the notice of the Superintendent of
Police who promised to do all he could. Nothing more has been heard

anxious to protect all the communities in Durban. But what could the
poor man do against the tremendous odds? Will his subordinates take
the trouble to find out the miscreants? When the aggrieved gentleman

asked him to get a warrant from the Magistrate for their arrest. No
warrant is required in such cases when a constable wants to do his

dock forced out of it. His cap was forcibly removed and he was
brought back bare-headed, in spite of the protest from the man that
the removal of the cap was contrary to Indian custom and it offended
his religious feeling also. A civil action was brought against the
Magistrate. And the judges held that the Magistrate was not civilly

This last instance I have quoted to show how unreasonable the
prejudice is in Natal. I could go on relating such instances. But, I
hope, I have adduced sufficient instances to show that our grievances
are real and as one of our sympathizers in England says in a letter,
“They have only to be known to be removed.”
Now, what is our mode of action in such cases? Are we to go to
Mr* Chamberlain in every case and turn the Colonial Office into one
for hearing petty complaints from Indians in South Africa? I have
used the word “petty” advisedly, for I admit that most of these cases
are cases of petty assault and inconvenience. But when they occur
pretty regularly, they assume a sufficiently big shape to be a source of
constant irritation to us. Just picture a country where you never know
you are safe from such assaults, no matter who you are, where you
have a nervous fear as to what would happen to you whenever you
undertake a journey, where you cannot be accommodated in a hotel
even for a night and you have a picture of the state we are living in
Natal. I am sure I am not exaggerating when I say that, if any of the
Indian High Court Judges came to South Africa, I doubt very much
whether any hotel would admit him, unless he took extraordinary
precautions, and I am almost positive that he will have to travel from
Charlestown to Pretoria in a Kaffir compartment, unless he is dressed
in European clothing from top to toe.
I am aware that in some of the instances cited above Mr*
Chamberlain could not very well afford relief, as for example the case
of Mr* DeSilva, but the fact is clear that such instances occur because
of the rooted prejudice against the Indians in South Africa, which is
due to the indifference of the Home and the Indian Governments to
the complaints of the Indians. In all the cases of assault, our mode of
action, as a rule, is not to take any notice of them. We follow the
principle, so far as we can, of going two miles when we are asked to go
one. Sufferance is, really and sincerely, the badge of the Indians in
South Africa, especially in Natal. I may state, however, that we follow
this policy not from philanthropic but from purely selfish motives. We
have found by painful experiences that to bring the offenders to
justice is a tedious and expensive process. The result is often contrary
to our expectations. The offender would either be discharged with a
caution or fined“five shillings or one day”. The very man, after
getting out of the box, assumes a more threatening attitude and puts

acts incites others to similar ones. We, therefore, do not, as a rule, even
mention them before the public in Natal.
Such a feeling of deep-seated hatred towards the Indians is
reproduced all over South Africa, in special legislation for Indians,
which has for its object the degradation of the Indian community in
that country. The Attorney-General of Natal wants to keep the Indians
for ever “hewers of wood and drawers of water”. We are classed with
the natives of South Africa—Kaffir race. He defines the status of the
Indians in the following words: “These Indians were brought here for
the purpose of supplying labour for development of local industries
and were not intended to form portion of the South African nation
which was being built up in the various States.” The policy of the
Orange Free State, which, in the words of its leading organ, “has made
the British Indian an impossibility by simply classifying him with the
South African natives”, is cherished by the other States as a model
policy. What that State has completely accomplished, the other States
would accomplish within a very short time but for the vigilance of the
Indian public. We are passing through a crisis now. We are hemmed in
on all sides by restrictions and high-handed measures.
I shall now show how the feeling of hatred above described has
been crystallized into legislation. An Indian cannot leave his house
after 9 o’clock at night unless he has a pass signed by someone
showing that he is out under instructions or can give a good account
of himself. This law applies to the natives and Indians only. The
police use their discretion and do not, as a rule, trouble those who are
dressed in the Memon costume, as that dress is supposed to be the
Indian trader’s dress. Mr* Aboobaker, now deceased, was the foremost
Indian trader in Natal and much respected by the European
community. He, with his friend, was once arrested by the police. When
he was brought to the police station for being out after 9 p. m., the
authorities knew at once that they had committed a mistake. They told
Mr* Aboobaker that they did not want to arrest gentlemen like
himself, and asked him if he could point out any distinguishing mark
between a trader and a labourer. Mr* Aboobaker pointed to his robe,
and, ever since, it has been a tacit understanding between the police
and the public that those wearing the flowing robe should not be
arrested, even though they may be out after 9 p.m. But there are

sensitive class—who do not wear robes. They are constantly molested.
A young Indian, well educated and a Sunday school teacher, another a
schoolmaster, were arrested only four months ago and locked up in a
dungeon the whole night, in spite of their protestations that they were
on their way home. They were discharged by the Magistrate but that
was a poor consolation. An Indian lady, a teacher, the wife of the
Indian Interpreter at Ladysmith, was a short time ago on her return
from the church on a Sunday evening, arrested by two Kaffir
policemen and roughly handled, so much so that her dress was soiled,
not to speak of all sorts of bad names she was called. She was locked
up in a cell. She was promptly released when the Superintendent of
Police came to know who she was. She was carried home senseless.
The bold lady sued the Corporation for damages for wrongful arrest
and got £20 and costs from the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice
remarked that her treatment was “unjust, harsh, arbitrary and
tyrannical”. The result, however, of these three cases is that the
Corporations are now clamouring for more powers and an alteration
of the law, in order that they may, to put it bluntly, subject all Indians,
irrespective of their position, to restrictions so that, as a member of the
Legislative Assembly said on the occasion of the passing of the
Immigration Bill of 1894, “the intention of the Colony to make the
Indian’s life more comfortable in his native land than in the Colony
of Natal” may be fulfilled. In any other country, such instances
would have excited the sympathy of all right-minded people and the
decision quoted above would have been hailed with joy.
Some eight months ago, about 20 Indians, pure labourers on
their way to the Durban market with vegetable baskets on their heads,
a sufficient indication that they were not vagrants, were arrested at 4
o’clock in the morning under the same law. The police prosecuted the
case vigorously. After a two days’ trial, the Magistrate discharged
them, but at what cost to the poor people! They were carrying their
day’s earnings in prospect on their shoulders. These were gone. They
were, I believe, detained for two days in gaol and had to pay their
attorney’s fees in the bargain, for having ventured to be up and doing
in the early morning, a fitting reward for industry! And Mr*
Chamberlain wants instances of real grievances!

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 4, 834486) A young Indian, well educated and a Sunday school teacher, another a schoolmaster, were arrested only four months ago and locked up in a dungeon the whole night, in spite of their protestations that they were on their way home.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 5, 834714) They were discharged by the Magistrate but that was a poor consolation.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 6, 834786) An Indian lady, a teacher, the wife of the Indian Interpreter at Ladysmith, was a short time ago on her return from the church on a Sunday evening, arrested by two Kaffir policemen and roughly handled, so much so that her dress was soiled, not to speak of all sorts of bad names she was called.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 7, 835081) She was locked up in a cell.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 8, 835110) She was promptly released when the Superintendent of Police came to know who she was.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 9, 835196) She was carried home senseless.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 10, 835228) The bold lady sued the Corporation for damages for wrongful arrest and got £20 and costs from the Supreme Court.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 11, 835341) The Chief Justice remarked that her treatment was “unjust, harsh, arbitrary and tyrannical”.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 12, 835434) The result, however, of these three cases is that the Corporations are now clamouring for more powers and an alteration of the law, in order that they may, to put it bluntly, subject all Indians, irrespective of their position, to restrictions so that, as a member of the Legislative Assembly said on the occasion of the passing of the Immigration Bill of 1894, “the intention of the Colony to make the Indian’s life more comfortable in his native land than in the Colony of Natal” may be fulfilled.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 13, 835934) In any other country, such instances would have excited the sympathy of all right-minded people and the decision quoted above would have been hailed with joy.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 14, 836093) Some eight months ago, about 20 Indians, pure labourers on their way to the Durban market with vegetable baskets on their heads, a sufficient indication that they were not vagrants, were arrested at 4 o’clock in the morning under the same law.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 15, 836337) The police prosecuted the case vigorously.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 16, 836380) After a two days’ trial, the Magistrate discharged them, but at what cost to the poor people!
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 17, 836474) They were carrying their day’s earnings in prospect on their shoulders.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 18, 836546) These were gone.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 19, 836563) They were, I believe, detained for two days in gaol and had to pay their attorney’s fees in the bargain, for having ventured to be up and doing in the early morning, a fitting reward for industry!
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 364, 1, 20, 836760) And Mr. Chamberlain wants instances of real grievances!

1 tenants are arrested under section 31, Law 25 of 1891*
When they are walking on their grounds, the policemen come and arrest them
and ask for their free passes. When they call out for their wives or relatives to
produce the passes, before they can be produced the policemen begin to drag
the Indians to the police-station. When the passes are produced on the road to
the station, the policemen simply look at them and throw them to the ground.
The Indians are taken to the police-station, detained for a night and made to
wash the cell out in the morning and are then brought before the Magistrate.
The Magistrate, without taking their pleas, fines them. When they reported
this to the Protector
2, he told them to go to the Magistrate, yet (adds the
correspondent) he is appointed to protect the Indian immigrants. If such
things exist in the Colony (continues the writer), to whom are they to appeal?

think, be a mistake.

causes much heart-burning, is their liability to arrest. Let me give a case in
point. A well-known Durban Indian who has property in various parts of the
town, a well-educated and exceedingly intelligent man, was the other night,
with his mother, visiting Sydenham, where also he has property. Met by two
native constables, the young man and his mother were taken into custody and
marched off to the police-station, though it is only fair to say the native
police conducted themselves admirably. The young Indian referred to
explained who he was and gave references and the trooper at length bade him
begone, warning him, however, that if he did not have a pass next time he
would be detained and prosecuted. Being a British subject in a British Colony,
he objects to being treated in this way, though, of course, he recognizes the
necessity of watchfulness in general. He makes a very strong point, however,
and one which the authorities should certainly consider.

New Para:  It will be only fair to state what the authorities have to say. They
admit the grievance but ask how they are to distinguish between an
indentured Indian and a free Indian. We, on the other hand, submit
that nothing can be easier. The indentured Indian never is dressed in a
fashionable dress. The presumption should be in favour of, not
against, the Indian, especially an Indian of the type I am referring to.
There is no more reason to presume a man to be a thief than to
presume an Indian to be a deserter. Even if an Indian did desert and
made preparations to look decent, it will be difficult for him to remain
undetected for a long time. But, then, the Indian in South Africa is not
credited with any feelings. He is a beast, “a thing black and lean”,
“the Asian dirt to be heartily cursed”.
There is, again, a law which says that natives and Indians, when
driving cattle, must be provided with certain passes; also a bye-law in
Durban which provides for the registration of native servants and
“others belonging to the uncivilized races of Asia”. This presupposes
that the Indian is a barbarian. There is a very good reason for
requiring registration of a native in that he is yet being taught the
dignity and necessity of labour. The Indian knows it and he is
imported because he knows it. Yet, to have the pleasure of classifying
him with the natives, he too is required to be registered. The
Superintendent of the Borough Police has never, so far as I know, put
the law in motion. Once I raised an objection, in defending an Indian
servant, that he was not registered. The Superintendent resented the
objection and said he never applied the law to Indians and asked me if
I wanted to see them degraded. The law, however, being there, may at
any time be used as an engine of oppression.
But we have not attempted to have any of these disabilities
removed. We are doing what we can to have their rigour mitigated
locally. For the present, our efforts are concentrated towards
preventing and getting repealed fresh legislation. Before referring to
that, I may further illustrate the proposition that the Indian is put on
the same level with the native in many other ways also. Lavatories are
marked “natives and Asiatics” at the railway stations. In the Durban
Post and Telegraph Offices, there were separate entrances for natives
and Asiatics and Europeans. We felt the indignity too much and many
respectable Indians were insulted and called all sorts of names by the
clerks at the counter. We petitioned the authorities to do away with the

entrances for natives, Asiatics and Europeans.
The Indians have, up to now, enjoyed the franchise rights under
the general franchise law of the colony, which requires ownership of
immovable property worth £50 or payment of an annual rental of £10
to qualify an adult male to be placed on the Voters’ Roll. There is a
special franchise law for the natives. Under the former, in 1894, there
were 9,309 European voters and 251 Indians, of whom only 203 were
living at the time, the populations being equal. Thus the European
vote in 1894 was 38 times as strong as the Indian vote. Yet, the
Government thought or pretended to think that there was a real
danger of the Asiatic vote swamping the Europeans. They, therefore,
introduced into the Legislative Assembly of Natal a Bill disfranchising
all Asiatics save those who were then rightly contained in any Voters’
List, the preamble of the Bill stating that the Asiatics were not
acquainted with elective representative institutions. Against this Bill we
memorialized both the Legislative Assembly
1 and the Legislative
Council
2 of Natal but to no purpose. We then memorialized Lord
Ripon
3 and forwarded copies of the memorial to the Press and the
public in India and England, with a view to enlist their sympathy and
to secure their active support which, we are thankful to say, we
received to some extent.
As a result, that Act has now been repealed and replaced by an
Act which says “no persons shall be qualified to have their names
inserted in any list of electors who (not being of European origin) are
natives or descendants in the male line of natives of countries which
have not hitherto possessed elective representative institutions founded
on the parliamentary franchise unless they shall first obtain an order
from the Governor-in-Council, exempting them from the operation of
the Act.” It also exempts from its operation those persons that are
rightly contained in any  Voters’ List.   This Bill was first submitted to  
Mr* Chamberlain who has practically approved of it. We, yet, thought

There is no real danger of the Asiatic vote swamping the European or

New Para:  The fact of the matter is that apart from numbers altogether the superior
race will always hold the reins of Government. We are inclined to the belief
therefore that the danger of the Indian vote swamping the European is a
chimerical one. We do not consider that the danger of being swamped is at all
a likely one, as past experience has proved that the class of Indians coming
here, as a rule, do not concern themselves about the franchise and further that
the majority of them do not even possess the small property qualification
required.
This admission has been reluctantly made. The Mercury
supposes, and we believe, that the Bill will fail in its purpose if it is to
debar the Asiatic from the franchise and says that it would not matter
if it does. What, then, is the object if it be not to harass the Indian
community? The real reason why the Bill has been introduced is thus
guardedly but frankly stated by the Mercury of the 23rd April, 1896:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 368, 2, 9, 845768) The fact of the matter is that apart from numbers altogether the superior race will always hold the reins of Government.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 368, 2, 10, 845889) We are inclined to the belief therefore that the danger of the Indian vote swamping the European is a chimerical one.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 368, 2, 11, 846007) We do not consider that the danger of being swamped is at all a likely one, as past experience has proved that the class of Indians coming here, as a rule, do not concern themselves about the franchise and further that the majority of them do not even possess the small property qualification required.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 368, 2, 12, 846310) This admission has been reluctantly made.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 368, 2, 13, 846352) The Mercury supposes, and we believe, that the Bill will fail in its purpose if it is to debar the Asiatic from the franchise and says that it would not matter if it does.

New Para:  Rightly or wrongly, justly or unjustly, a strong feeling exists among
the Europeans in South Africa, and especially in the two Republics, against
Indians or any other Asiatics being allowed unrestricted right to the franchise.
The Indian argument, or course, is that there is only one Indian to every 38
European voters on the Roll at present with the open franchise and that the
danger anticipated is imaginary. Perhaps it is, but we have to deal with it as if
it were a real danger, not altogether, as we have explained, because of our
views, but because of the views we know to be strongly held by the rest of the
Europeans in the country. We do not want isolation again under the far greater
and more fatal ban of being a semi-Asiatic country out of touch and out of
harmony with the other European Governments of the country.

New Para:  This, then, is the naked truth. In obedience to the popular
outcry, justly or unjustly, the Asiatic must be put down. This Bill has
been passed after a secret meeting was held by the Government at
which they explained the real reasons for passing the Bill. It has been
condemned by the Colonists’ and the other newspapers as inadequate
from their point of view and by the very members who voted for it.
They hold that the Bill will not apply to the Indians because they
possess in India “elective representative institutions founded on the
Parliamentary franchise and that it will involve the Colony in endless
litigation and agitation”. We, too, have taken up the same ground. We
have urged that the Legislative Councils in India are “elective
representative institutions founded on the Parliamentary franchise”.
Of course, in the popular sense of the term, we have no such
institutions, but in the opinion of the London Times and an able jurist
in Durban our institutions can well be legally classified under those
described in the Bill. The Times says “the argument that he (the
Indian) has no franchise whatever in India in inconsistent with facts.”
Mr* Laughton, an eminent lawyer in Natal, writing to a newspaper on
the subject, says:

New Para:  Is there, then, a Parliamentary (or legislative) franchise in India, and
what is it? There is, and it was created by the Acts 24 and 25 Victoria, Chapter
67, and 55 and 56 Victoria, Chapter 140, by the regulations made under
Section 4 of the latter Act. It may not be founded on what we call a liberal
basis, it may indeed be founded on a very crude basis, but it is the
Parliamentary franchise nevertheless and, under the Bill it is on it that
elective representative institutions of India have to be founded.
This is also the opinion of other eminent men in Natal. Mr*
Chamberlain, however, in his despatch
1 in  connection with the matter
says:

New Para:  a Colony is allowed to treat the Indians on a different footing from
the Europeans in one respect, there would be no difficulty in going
further. Their goal is not merely disfranchisement. Their goal is total
extinction of the Indian. He may be allowed to exist there as a pariah,
as an indentured labourer, at the most a free labourer, but he must not
aspire higher. At the time the first Franchise Bill was introduced, in
response to the clamour for Municipal disfranchisement of the
Indians, the Attorney-General said that would be dealt with in the near
future. The Natal Government, about a year ago, wished to convene
what was called a “Coolie Conference”, so that there might be
uniformity in Indian legislation throughout South Africa. At that time
also, the Deputy Mayor of Durban moved a resolution that the
Asiatics should be induced to live in separate locations. The
Government are vexing themselves to find out how they can directly
and effectively check the influx of the Indian traders, whom Mr*
Chamberlain describes to be “peaceable, law-abiding, meritorious
body of persons whose undoubted industry and intelligence and
indomitable perseverance”, he hopes, “will suffice to overcome any
obstacles which may now face them in pursuit of their avocations”.
The present Bill, therefore, we humbly think, has to be taken in
connection with these facts and treated accordingly. The London
Times has put the franchise question in this form:

New Para:  With reference to the time-expired Indians, I do not think that it ought
to be compulsory on any man to go to any part of the world save for a crime
for which he is transported. I hear a great deal of this question. I have been
asked again and again to take a different view but I have not been able to do it.
A man is brought here, in theory with his own consent, in practice very often
without. He gives the best five years of his life, he forms new ties, forgets the
old ones perhaps, establishes a home here and he cannot, according to my
view of right and wrong, be sent back. Better by far to stop the further
introduction of Indians altogether than to take what work you can out of them
and order them away.
But now that which was meritorious 10 years ago in the Indian,
namely, his service to the Colony for 5 years for a paltry wage, has
become a crime for which he would deserve transportation to India, if
the Natal Attorney-General be allowed to do so by the Indian and the
Home Governments. I may mention that the Indian Government, on
the representation of an ex parte Commission
1 that visited India from
Natal in 1893, have accepted the principle of compulsory indenture.

1 are sufficient to
induce the latter to alter their views.
Although we have not moved in the matters specially affecting
the Indians now serving their indenture, one may well presume that
their lot will not be practically comfortable on the estates. We think
that the alteration in the Colony’s tone with regard to the general
population will affect the masters also of the indentured Indians. One
or two matters, however, I have been asked to especially bring to the
notice of the public. A representation was made, even as far back as
1891, by an Indian Committee headed by Mr* Haji Mohamed Haji
Dada, one of the prayers whereof being that the Protector of
Immigrants should be a man knowing the Tamil and the Hindustani
languages and should, if possible, be an Indian. We have not receded
from that position, but the interval has merely confirmed that opinion.
The present Protector is an estimable gentleman. His ignorance of the
languages, however, cannot but be a serious drawback. We humbly
consider also that the protector should be instructed to act as an
advocate for the Indian more than as Judge between the employers
and the immigrants. I shall illustrate what I say. An Indian named
Balasundaram was, in 1894, so ill-treated by his master that two of his
teeth were nearly knocked out; they came out through his upper lip
causing an issue of blood sufficient to soak his long turban in it. His
master admitted the fact but pleaded grave provocation, denied by the
man. On receiving the punishment, he seems to have gone to the
Protector’s house which was close by his master’s. The Protector sent
word that he must go to his office the next day.
The  man went, then, to the Magistrate who was much moved at
the sight. The turban was kept in court and he was at once sent to the
hospital for treatment. The man after having been kept in the hospital
for a few days was discharged. He had heard about me and came to
my office. He had not recovered sufficiently to be able to speak. I
asked him, therefore, to write out his complaint in Tamil which he
knew. He wanted to prosecute the master so that his contract of
indenture might be cancelled. I asked him if he would be satisfied if
his indenture was transferred. On his nodding consent to what I said, I
wrote to his master asking if he would consent to transfer the services
of the man. He was at first unwilling but subsequently consented. I

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 15, 857040) The Protector sent word that he must go to his office the next day.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 16, 857108) The man went, then, to the Magistrate who was much moved at the sight.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 17, 857179) The turban was kept in court and he was at once sent to the hospital for treatment.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 18, 857263) The man after having been kept in the hospital for a few days was discharged.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 19, 857341) He had heard about me and came to my office.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 20, 857386) He had not recovered sufficiently to be able to speak.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 21, 857441) I asked him, therefore, to write out his complaint in Tamil which he knew.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 22, 857516) He wanted to prosecute the master so that his contract of indenture might be cancelled.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 23, 857604) I asked him if he would be satisfied if his indenture was transferred.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 24, 857675) On his nodding consent to what I said, I wrote to his master asking if he would consent to transfer the services of the man.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 372, 1, 25, 857800) He was at first unwilling but subsequently consented.

who gave the man’s version to the Protector. The Protector desired the
man to be left in his office and sent word that he would do his best.
The master, in the mean while, went to the Protector’s office and
changed his mind, saying his wife would not agree to the transfer
because his services were invaluable. The man was then said to have
compromised and to have given the Protector a written document to
the effect that he had no complaint to make. He sent me a note to the
effect that as the man had no complaint to make and his master did
not consent to transfer the services he would not interfere in the
matter. I ask if this was right. Was it right for the Protector to have
taken such a document from the man? Did he want to protect himself
against the man? To proceed, however, with the painful story,
naturally the note sent a shock through my body. I had hardly
recovered when the man came to my office crying and saying the
Protector would not transfer him. I literally ran to the Protector’s
office and inquired what the matter was. He placed the written
document before me and asked me how he could help the man. He
said the man should not have signed the document. And this
document was an affidavit attested by the Protector himself. I told the
Protector that I should advise the man to go to the Magistrate and
lodge a complaint. He said the document would be produced before
the Magistrate and it would be useless. He advised me, therefore, to
drop the matter. I returned to my office and wrote a letter to his
master imploring him to consent to the transfer. The master would do
nothing of the kind. The magistrate treated us quite differently. He
had seen the man while the blood was yet dripping from his lips. The
deposition was duly made. On the day of hearing, I explained the
whole circumstances and again appealed to the master in open court
and offered to withdraw the complaint if he consented to the transfer.
The Magistrate then gave the master to understand that, unless he
considered my offer more favourably than he seemed to do at the
time, consequences might be serious for him. He went on to say that
he thought the man was brutally treated. The master said he gave
provocation. The Magistrate retorted: “You had no business to take
the law in your own hands and beat the man as if he were a beast.” He
adjourned the case for one day in order to enable the master to
consider the offer made by me. The master, of course, came down and
consented. The Protector then wrote to me that he would not agree to
transfer unless I submitted a European name he could approve of.

New Para:  Happily, the Colony is not quite devoid of benevolent men. A
Wesleyan local preacher and solicitor, out of charity, undertook to
take over the man’s services, and thus ended the last act of this painful
drama. Comment is superfluous as to the procedure adopted by the
Protector. This is only a typical instance showing how hard it is for the
indentured men to get justice.
We submit that no matter who he is, his duties should be clearly
defined as are those of judges, advocates, solicitors and others. Certain
things, for the sake of avoiding temptations, he should not be able to
do in spite of himself. Just fancy a judge being the guest of a criminal
who is being tried before him. Yet, the Protector, when he goes to the
estates to enquire about the condition of the men and to hear
complaints, can and does often become the guest of the employers.
We submit that this practice is wrong in principle, no matter how high-
minded the Protector may be. As a Surgeon-Superintendent of
Immigrants remarked the other day, the Protector should be easily
approachable to the meanest coolie, but he should be unapproachable
to the lordliest employer. He may not be a Natal man. It also looks a
strange procedure to appoint as Protector a member of a Commission
whose object is to induce the Indian Government to consent to pass
harsher laws for the indentured Indians. When the Protector has to
perform such a conflicting duty, who is to protect the indentured
men?
It should be easy for the immigrant to have his services
transferred. There are in the gaol some Indians who have been there
for years because they refuse to go to their employers. They say they
have complaints which, owing to the peculiar circumstances in which
they are placed, they cannot substantiate. A Magistrate was so much
disgusted with the business that he wished he had not to try such cases.

master and, if they again refuse to work, it can be readily seen that they do not
want to work. If a coolie is ill-treated it may be said that he can complain to
the Magistrate, but it is not an easy matter for any coolie to prove such cases.
It is a matter altogether for the Protector of Immigrants to inquire into and
remedy, if possible.
There is an Immigration Trust Board that consists of employers
of Indians. They have now received very wide powers. And seeing the
position they occupy, their acts will have to be very jealously watched
by the Indian Government. The punishment for desertion is heavy
enough, and yet they are now seriously considering whether some
stiffer mode of dealing with such cases could not be devised. It should
be remembered, however, that, in at least 9 cases out of 10, the so-
called deserters complain of ill-treatment, and such deserters are
protected under the law from punishment, but as the poor fellows
cannot establish their complaints, they are treated as real deserters and
sent by the Protector to the Magistrate for punishment accordingly.
Under such circumstances, any alteration for the worse in the law
about desertion should, we submit, require careful consideration.

New Para:  A feature of the annual report of the Protector of Immigrants, to which
more public attention should be given than is the case, is that referring to the
number of suicides which take place every year among the indentured coolies
on the estates. This year the number recorded is six out of a total of 8,828* A
large number occurred in 1894* It is, however, a very high percentage and
raises the suspicion that on some estates a system of treatment exists towards
the coolie labourers much akin to slave-driving. It is extremely significant
that so many suicides should occur on certain estates. This is a point which
calls for investigation. Apparently, no inquiry of any kind is held into the
cases with a view to ascertain whether the treatment meted out to unfortunate
wretches, who prefer death to life, is such as to render existence an intolerable
misery. The matter is one which is apt to pass unnoticed. It, however, ought
not to do so. In a recent case of desertion on the part of several coolies from
an estate down South, the prisoners openly declared in Court that they would
rather kill themselves than return to their employer. The Magistrate said he
had no option but to order them back to serve out their indentures. It is time

Indian has no effectual mode of appeal against whatever brutality may be
inflicted on him on the plantations.
We, however, wish to guard ourselves against being understood
to say that the life of the indentured Indians in Natal is harder than in
any other country, or that this is a part of the general grievances of the
Indians in the Colony. On the other hand, we know that there are
estates in Natal where the Indians are very well treated. At the same
time, we do humbly submit that the lot of the indentured Indians is
not all that it might be and that there are points which require
attention.
When an indentured Indian loses his free pass, he is charged £3
for the duplicate. The reason for this is the alleged fraudulent sale by
the Indians of their passes. But, surely, such fraudulent sale can be
criminally punished. A man who has sold his pass should never be
able to get a duplicate even on a payment of £30* On the other hand,
it should be as easy for an ordinary Indian to get a duplicate as the
original. They are supposed to carry their passes about their persons.
No wonder if they are frequently lost. I know a man who could not
get a duplicate because he had not £3 with him. He wanted to go to
Johannesburg and he could not go. The practice in the Protector’s
department in such cases is to issue temporary passes so that the men
may be able to make a present of their first £3 earned to the
Protector’s office. In the case I am referring to, the man had a
temporary pass issued for six months. He could not earn £3 during
that time. There are dozens of such cases. I have no hesitation in
saying that this is nothing but a system of blackmail.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 376, 1, 10, 867233) A man who has sold his pass should never be able to get a duplicate even on a payment of £30. On the other hand, it should be as easy for an ordinary Indian to get a duplicate as the original.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 376, 1, 11, 867426) They are supposed to carry their passes about their persons.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 376, 1, 12, 867487) No wonder if they are frequently lost.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 376, 1, 13, 867526) I know a man who could not get a duplicate because he had not £3 with him.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 376, 1, 15, 867654) The practice in the Protector’s department in such cases is to issue temporary passes so that the men may be able to make a present of their first £3 earned to the Protector’s office.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 376, 1, 16, 867838) In the case I am referring to, the man had a temporary pass issued for six months.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 376, 1, 17, 867921) He could not earn £3 during that time.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 376, 1, 18, 867960) There are dozens of such cases.

THE  CAPE  COLONY
In the Cape Colony, the Mayoral Congress has passed a
resolution signifying its desire for legislation prohibiting the influx of
Asiatics in that Colony and hoping that prompt action will be taken.
The Cape Legislature has, lately, passed a measure which gives the
East London Municipality in that Colony the power to make bye-laws
compelling natives and Indians to remove to and reside in certain
locations and prohibiting them from walking on foot-paths. It is
difficult to conceive a better instance of cruel persecution. The
following is the position of the Indians in East Griqualand under the
Cape Government, according to the Mercury of 23rd March, 1896:

New Para:  An Arab, named Ismail Suliman, erected a store in East Griqualand, paid
customs duty upon goods and applied for a licence, which the Magistrate
refused. Mr* Attorney Francis, on the Arab’s behalf, appealed to the Cape
Government who upheld the Magistrate and have issued instructions that no
coolies or Arabs are to have trading licences in East Griqualand and the one or
two that have licences are to be closed up.
Thus, in some parts of Her Majesty’s Dominions In South
Africa, even the vested rights of her Indian subjects are not to be
protected. What happened to the Indian in the end I was unable to
ascertain. There are many cases where Indians have been
unceremoniously refused licences to trade. There is a Bluebook on
Native Affairs published in Natal. One of the Magistrates therein
says he simply refuses to issue trading licences to Indians and thus
prevents Indian encroachments.

New Para:  It affords me pleasure to be able to say, and say truthfully, that the
meeting was in no way a representative one. Had it been so, little credit would
thereby have been reflected on the inhabitants of the town. Some half a dozen
leading storekeepers, the editor of a paper, a sprinkling of minor Government
officials and a fairly large collection of prospectors, mechanics and artisans
made up the assembly which those under whose direction it was held would
have us believe represented the voice of the police of Salisbury. The
resolutions, which I have already wired you with the [names of] proposers and
seconders, were nicely cut and dried before the meeting commenced and the
figures were set in order and worked in their places when the time arrived.
There were no Indians present and no one ventured a word on their behalf.
Why, it is hard to say, for it is certain that the feeling of by far the majority in
this town is altogether adverse to the one-sided, selfish and narrow-minded
opinion expressed by those who essayed to speak on the question. . . . I
cannot help thinking that little, if any, harm need be feared from the advent of
a race who are industrious and steady and who, in higher sphere, have on
occasion given evidences of their capabilities in upholding positions which
they maintain ably and honourably side by side with their lighter-skinned

New Para:  Mr* Chamberlain has now given his decision on the memorial and,
while sympathizing with the prayer thereof, has accepted the award of
the Arbitrator. He has, however, promised and retained the right to
make friendly representations to the Transvaal Government from time
to time. And, if the representations are emphatic enough, we have no
doubt that we shall get justice in the end. We, therefore, implore the
public bodies to exert their influence so that these representations may
be such as to have their desired effect. I shall venture to quote an
instance in point. When, during the Malaboch war,
3 the  British
subjects were being commandeered, many protested against it and
asked for the interference of the Home Government. The reply first
sent was to the effect that they could not interfere with the affairs of
the Republic. The papers, however, were enraged and memorials
strongly worded were repeated. At last came the request to the
Transvaal Government not to commandeer British subjects. It was not
an interference, yet the request had to be granted and the
commandeering of British subjects was stopped. May we hope for
such a request which carries with it its fulfilment? If we are not as
important a community as that concerned with the commando
movement our grievances, we submit, are much more so.
 
Whether such or any representations are made or not, there will
arise questions out of the award that will engage Mr* Chamberlain’s
attention. What shall be done with the hundreds of Indian stores in the
Transvaal? Will they all be closed up? Will they all be made to live in

New Para:  To be forced into a small location on a spot used as a place to deposit
the refuse of the town, without any water except the polluted soakage in the
gully between the location and the town, must inevitably result in malignant
fevers and other diseases breaking out amongst them whereby their lives and
the health of the community in town will be endangered. (Green book No. 2,
1893, page 72)
Will they or will they not receive any compensation if they are
made to sell off? Again, the very law is ambiguous. The Arbitrator was
called upon to decide upon the interpretation which he has now left to
the High Court of the Transvaal. We contend that by the law the State
can only compel us to reside in locations. The State contends that
residence includes trading stores also and that, therefore, we may not,
under that law, even trade except in specified locations. The High
court is said to favour the State interpretation.
Nor are these the only grievances in the Transvaal. These were
the subject of the arbitration. But there is a law which prevents the
railway authorities in the Transvaal from issuing first or second-class
tickets on the railways. There is a tin compartment reserved for natives
and other coloured people in which we are literally packed like sheep,
without regard to our dress, our behaviour or our position. In Natal,
there is no such law but the petty officials give trouble. The hardship
is not insignificant. In Delagoa Bay, the authorities so respect the
Indian that they would not allow him to travel 3rd class, so much so
that, if a poor Indian could not afford the 2nd-class fare, he is allowed
to travel 2nd class under a 3rd-class ticket. The same Indian, as soon
as he reaches the Transvaal border, is compelled to put his dignity into
his pocket, asked to produce a pass and then unceremoniously thrust
into the third-class compartment, no matter whether he has a first-class
or a second-class  ticket.  The journey  is long enough  to be felt  like
a  month’s  journey in those uncomfortable quarters. The same thing
happens on the Natal side. Four months ago, an Indian gentleman got
a second-class ticket for Pretoria at Durban. He was assured that he
would be all right, yet he was not only forcibly put out at Volksrust, a
station on the Transvaal border, but could not proceed by that train
because it did not carry any third-class compartment. These
regulations seriously interfere with our carrying on our trade also.
There are many who, owing to such inconveniences, would not move
from place to place unless they could not possibly avoid it.
Then, in the Transvaal, an Indian, like the native of South
Africa, has to carry a travelling pass which costs a shilling. This is the

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 9, 877382) The High court is said to favour the State interpretation.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 13, 877671) There is a tin compartment reserved for natives and other coloured people in which we are literally packed like sheep, without regard to our dress, our behaviour or our position.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 14, 877850) In Natal, there is no such law but the petty officials give trouble.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 16, 877954) In Delagoa Bay, the authorities so respect the Indian that they would not allow him to travel 3rd class, so much so that, if a poor Indian could not afford the 2nd-class fare, he is allowed to travel 2nd class under a 3rd-class ticket.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 17, 878190) The same Indian, as soon as he reaches the Transvaal border, is compelled to put his dignity into his pocket, asked to produce a pass and then unceremoniously thrust into the third-class compartment, no matter whether he has a first-class or a second-class ticket.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 18, 878455) The journey is long enough to be felt like a month’s journey in those uncomfortable quarters.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 19, 878549) The same thing happens on the Natal side.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 20, 878591) Four months ago, an Indian gentleman got a second-class ticket for Pretoria at Durban.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 21, 878678) He was assured that he would be all right, yet he was not only forcibly put out at Volksrust, a station on the Transvaal border, but could not proceed by that train because it did not carry any third-class compartment.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 22, 878897) These regulations seriously interfere with our carrying on our trade also.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 23, 878972) There are many who, owing to such inconveniences, would not move from place to place unless they could not possibly avoid it.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 380, 1, 24, 879098) Then, in the Transvaal, an Indian, like the native of South Africa, has to carry a travelling pass which costs a shilling.

post-cart and had to walk a distance of three miles, at the point of the

there is a bye-law to that effect passed by the Sanitary Board. A

New Para:  Such then is the position of the Indians in South Africa, except
Delagoa Bay where the Indians are very much respected, labour under
no special disability and are owners of nearly half the fixed property
in the principal streets of that city. They are all of them mostly
traders. Some of them are in Government employment also. There are
two Parsee gentlemen who are Engineers. And there is another Parsee
gentleman whom, perhaps, even a child in Delagoa Bay knows by the
name of “Senhor Edul”. The trading class, however, chiefly consists
of Mahomedans and Banias, mostly from Portuguese India.
 
It yet remains for me to examine the cause of this deplorable
state of things, as also the remedy. The Europeans say that the habits
of the Indians are insanitary, they spend nothing and that they are
untruthful and immoral. These are the objections according to the
most moderate journals. Others, of course, simply abuse us. The

is to say, the sanitary habits of the Indian community as a whole, in

cleanly in their persons and free from the personal diseases due to dirt
or careless habits” and finds also that “their dwellings are generally
clean and sanitation is willingly attended to by them.”
1 But we do not
say we are beyond improvement in this matter. We may not live quite
satisfactorily if there were no sanitary laws. Both the communities err
equally in this respect, as the newspaper records would show. That,
however, cannot be a reason for all the serious disabilities that are
imposed upon us. The cause lies elsewhere, as I shall presently show.
Let them enforce the sanitary law very strictly, and we shall be all the
better for that. Those of us who are lazy will be properly aroused
from our lethargy. As to untruthfulness, the charge, to a certain extent,
is true, with regard to the indentured Indians, utterly exaggerated with
regard to the traders. But the indentured Indians, placed in the
position they are, I venture to say, have done much better than any
other community would do in a similar position. The very fact that
they are liked as servants by the Colonists and called “useful and
trusty”, shows that they are not the incorrigible liars they are made
out to be. However, the moment they leave India, they are free from
the healthy checks that keep them on the narrow path. In South
Africa, they are without any religious instruction, though they need it
badly. They are called upon to give evidence against their masters for
the sake of a fellow brother. This duty they often shirk. Gradually,
therefore, their faculty for adhering to the truth, under all

would perhaps trust both equally, they rely upon the Indian’s thrift,
his determination not to ruin his creditor and his temperate habits. A
bank has been giving credit to an Indian to a very large extent. A
European gentleman, known to the bank and a friend of this Indian,
wanted £300 credit for speculation. The bank refused to give him
credit without guarantee. The Indian friend pledged his honour, and
that was all he had to pledge, and the bank accepted that security,
although at the time, too, he was heavily in debt to the bank. The
result is the European friend has failed to refund the £300 to the bank,
and the Indian friend, for the present, has lost the money. The
European, of course, lives in a better style and requires some drink for
his dinners, and our Indian friend drinks only water. The charges that
we spend nothing and are immoral, i.e., more than those who bring
the charges against us, we repudiate entirely. But the real cause is the
trade jealousy, in the first instance, and want of knowledge about
Indian and the Indians, in the second.
The hue and cry against the Indians was first raised by the
traders and then taken up by the populace till, at last, the prejudice
permeated the high and the low. This can be seen from the South
African legislation affecting Indians. The Orange Free Staters have
frankly stated that they hate the Asiatic because he is a successful
trader. The Chambers of Commerce in the different States were the
first movers. And they, of course, came out with the statements that we
believed the Christians a natural prey, and that we believed our women
to be soulless and were propagators of leprosy and syphilis and other
diseases. The matters have now reached such a stage that for a good
Christian gentleman it is as natural to see nothing unjust in the
persecution of the Asiatic as it was in the olden days for the bonafide
Christians to see nothing wrong or un-Christian in slavery. Mr* Henry
Bale is a legislator in the Natal Assembly, a typical English gentleman,
and is dubbed Bale the Conscientious because he is a converted
Christian and takes a prominent part in religious movements and
brings his conscience often into play on the floor of the Assembly
House. Yet, this gentleman is one of the most powerful and
uncompromising opponents of Indians, and gives his certificate that
an annual poll-tax of £3 on a body of men who have been the
mainstay of the Colony, and compulsory return of such men, are just
and humane measures.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 384, 1, 12, 888082) The hue and cry against the Indians was first raised by the traders and then taken up by the populace till, at last, the prejudice permeated the high and the low.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 384, 1, 17, 888703) The matters have now reached such a stage that for a good Christian gentleman it is as natural to see nothing unjust in the persecution of the Asiatic as it was in the olden days for the bonafide Christians to see nothing wrong or un-Christian in slavery.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 384, 1, 18, 888959) Mr. Henry Bale is a legislator in the Natal Assembly, a typical English gentleman, and is dubbed Bale the Conscientious because he is a converted Christian and takes a prominent part in religious movements and brings his conscience often into play on the floor of the Assembly House.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 384, 1, 19, 889243) Yet, this gentleman is one of the most powerful and uncompromising opponents of Indians, and gives his certificate that an annual poll-tax of £3 on a body of men who have been the mainstay of the Colony, and compulsory return of such men, are just and humane measures.

At any rate, that is our goal. We would often fall short of that ideal but
we can adduce innumerable instances to show that we have acted in
that spirit. We do not attempt to have individuals punished but as a
rule, patiently suffer wrongs at their hands. Generally, our prayers are
not to demand compensation for past injuries, but to render a
repetition of those injuries impossible and to remove the causes. Our
grievances have been laid before the Indian public in the same spirit.
If we have quoted instances of personal injuries, that we have done not

position vividly before the public in India. We are trying to remove
any causes that may be in us for such treatment. But we cannot
succeed without the sympathy and support of the public men in India,

New Para:  Imperial policy that India’s surplus population is to be encouraged, rather
than discouraged, to find fresh outlets in those other portions of the Empire
which are in need of a labouring population. It will thus be seen that the
question of coolie immigration into the British Colonies is one which
reaches down to the deepest amelioration and salvation of India; it may even
mean the inclusion or exclusion of that great possession in or from the
British Empire. That is the Imperial aspect of the question, and is one which
points directly to a desire on the part of the Imperial Government to do all in
its power to prevent the raising, in other portions of the Empire, of barriers
for the prevention of Indian immigration.

New Para:  As regards the local aspect of Indian immigration, what has to be
considered is whether and if so, how far, does this Imperial policy conflict
with what is desirable for this particular locality? There are those who
absolutely condemn Indian immigration into this Colony, but it is doubtful
whether these have given full consideration on all the bearings of the case. In
the first place, those who so oppose Indian immigration have to answer the
question: What would this Colony have done without them in those
departments of industry in which they have undoubtedly proved useful? There
is unquestionably much that is undesirable about the coolie, but before his
presence here is condemned as an unmixed evil, it has to be shown that the
Colony would have been better without him. This, we think, would be
somewhat difficult to prove. There can be no question that the coolie is the
best fitted, under existing local conditions, for the field labour required in
connection with the agriculture of the Colony. Such work can never be
undertaken in this climate by white men; our natives show little disposition
or aptitude for it. This being so, who is ousted by the presence of the coolie as
an agricultural labourer? No one. The work had either to be done by him or left
undone altogether. Again, the coolie is largely employed by Government
especially on the railway. What is the objection to him there? It may be said
he is taking the place of the white man there; but is he? There may be a few
isolated cases in which this contention could afford to replace all the Indians
employed in the Government service by white men. Further, the towns in
Natal are almost entirely dependent for their supply of vegetables upon the
coolies, who farm plots of ground in the vicinity. With whom does the coolie
interfere in this direction? Certainly not with the white man. Our farmers, as a
body, have not yet acquired a taste for kitchen gardening sufficient to keep the
market fully supplied. Neither does he interfere with the native, who, being
the incarnation of indolence, does not, as a rule, trouble about the cultivation
of anything except mealies

the necessary supply. The debt which the white man owes to these coloured
labourers is this that they, by occupying the lowest stratum of society in
those mixed communities of which they form a part, raise the white man one
stratum higher right through the social scale than he otherwise would have
occupied, had the menial offices been discharged by a European class. For
instance, the white man, who is ‘boss’ over a gang of coolies, would have had
himself to form one of the gang of labourers, had there been no black
labourer. Again, the man who, in Europe, would have been that man’s
foreman, in this country develops into a master tradesman. And as in every
other direction, by the presence of a black labouring class, the whites are set
free to throw their efforts into higher planes than they could have done, had
the majority of them had to devote their lives to the arduous labours of toilers
of the lowest order. It will, therefore, probably yet be found that the removal
of the drawbacks, at present incidental to the immigration of Indians into
British Colonies, is not to be effected so much by the adoption of an obsolete
policy of exclusion as by an enlightened and progressive application of
ameliorating laws to those Indians who settle in them. One of the chief
objections to Indians in that they do not live in accordance with European
rules. The remedy for this is to gradually raise their mode of life by
compelling them to live in better dwellings and by creating among them new
wants, it will probably be found easier, because more in accord with the great
onward movement of  mankind,  to demand to such settlers that they shall  rise
to their new conditions, than to endeavour to maintain the status quo ante by
their entire exclusion.
Such articles (and they can be quoted by the dozen from the
various newspapers) show that application of sufficient pressure from
the Home Government can bring about a healthy change in the Indian
policy of the Colonies, and that, even in the worst places, British love
of justice and fair play can be roused. These two are the sheet-anchor
of our hope. No amount of spreading information about India on our
part can do any good without the much-needed application of the
pressure.
The following article, from the pen of a veteran journalist in
South Africa, shows also that there are men in South Africa who
would rise above their surroundings and disclose the true British

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 388, 1, 8, 899721) One of the chief objections to Indians in that they do not live in accordance with European rules.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 388, 1, 9, 899820) The remedy for this is to gradually raise their mode of life by compelling them to live in better dwellings and by creating among them new wants, it will probably be found easier, because more in accord with the great onward movement of mankind, to demand to such settlers that they shall rise to their new conditions, than to endeavour to maintain the status quo ante by their entire exclusion.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 388, 1, 10, 900216) Such articles (and they can be quoted by the dozen from the various newspapers) show that application of sufficient pressure from the Home Government can bring about a healthy change in the Indian policy of the Colonies, and that, even in the worst places, British love of justice and fair play can be roused.

New Para:  It sometimes happens in life that men are called upon to decide
decisively between the claims of justice and the claims of self. With men of
honourable inclination, the task is, of course, a far heavier one than with men
whose natures have long ago cast overboard any conscientious scruples with
which they may have been endowed at the outset of their unlovely existence.

New Para:  From men who will puff rotten companies at the very moment they are selling
out and individuals of a like character, it is, of course, perfectly absurd to
expect any other result than that self will predominate, but with the average
commercial man, justice is more often the victor in the ethical conflict.
Amongst the causes of these conflicts, as they affect South Africans generally
and British Transvaalers in particular, is the question of the ‘coolie traders’,
as our Indian and Arab fellow citizens are designated. It is the position of
these merchants, for so they really are, which has aroused so much attention
and which is still productive of no little interest and hostility to this day. And
it is in considering their position that their rivals in trade have sought to
inflict upon them, through the medium of the State, what looks, on the face of
it, something very like an injustice for the benefit of self.

New Para:  In the face of such reminders as these, one may reasonably expect
to be pardoned for referring, for a few moments, to a body of respectable,
hard-working men, whose position is so misunderstood that their very
nationality is overlooked, and a name labelled to them which tends to place
them on an exceedingly low level in the estimation of their fellow creatures. 
In the face, too, of financial operations, the success of which many of
their detractors would envy one fails to understand the agitation which would
place the operators in the same category as the half-heathen native and
confine them to locations and subject them to the harsher laws by which the
Transvaal Kaffir is governed. The impression, which is but too prevalent both
in the Transvaal and this Colony, that the quiet and altogether inoffensive
‘Arab’ shopkeeper, and the equally harmless Indian, who carries his pack of
dainty wares from house to house, is a ‘coolie’, is due largely to an indolent
ignorance as to the race whence they sprang. When one reflects that the
conception of Brahminism, with its poetic and mysterious mythology, took
its rise in the land of the ‘coolie trader’, that in that land, twenty-four
centuries ago, the almost divine Buddha taught and practised the glorious
doctrine of self-sacrifice, and that it was from the plains and mountains of that
weird old country that are derived the fundamental truths of the very language
we speak, one cannot but help regretting that the children of such a race
should be treated as the equals of the children of black heathendom and outer
darkness. Those who, for a few moments, have stayed to converse with the
Indian trader have been, perhaps, surprised to find they are speaking to a
scholar and a gentleman. In the schools of Bombay, Madras, and even from

New Para:  It is about time that those who cry out against the Indian merchant
should have pointed out to them who and what he is. Many of his worst
detractors are British subjects enjoying all the privileges and rights of
membership in a glorious community. To them the hatred of injustice and the
love of fair play is inherent, and when it affects themselves, they have a
method of insisting upon their rights and liberties, whether under a foreign
government or under their own. Possibly, it has never struck them that the
Indian merchant is also a British subject and claims the same liberties and
rights with equal justice. To say the very least of it, if we may be permitted to
employ a phrase of Palmerston’s days, it is very un-English to claim rights
one would not allow to others. The right of trade as an equal privilege has,
since the abolition of the Elizabethan monopolies, become almost a part of
the English Constitution, and were anyone to interfere with that right, the
privilege of British citizenship would very suddenly come to the front.
Because the Indian is more successful in competition and lives on less than
the English merchant, is the unfairest and weakest of arguments. The very
foundation of English commerce lies in the fact of our being able to compete
more successfully with other nations. Surely, it is Protection running to
madness when English traders wish the State to intervene to protect them
against the more successful operations of their rivals. The injustice to the
Indians is so glaring that one is almost ashamed of one’s countrymen in
wishing to have these men treated as natives, simply because of their success
in trade. The very reason that they have been so successful against the
dominant race is sufficient to raise them above that degrading level. (Cape

New Para:  The Indian Government and the Indians themselves believe that it is in
Southern Africa that this question of their status must be determined. If they
secure the position of British subjects in South Africa, it will be almost
impossible to deny it to them elsewhere. If they fail to secure that position in

Government since 1893 A.D* Before September of 1893, Natal was a
Crown Colony having a Legislative Council of 12 elective and 4
executive members, with a Governor representing the Queen, a

Responsible Government was granted, whereby an upper and a lower
chamber were created. The upper chamber, called the Legislative
Council, consists of 11 members nominated by His Excellency the
Governor of the colony, and the lower chamber, styled the Legislative
Assembly, consists of 37 members elected by the Colonists possessing
the legal qualifications to be hereafter described. There is a movable
ministry of five members based on the model of the British Cabinet.

Natal has an area of 20,851 square miles
1 and a European
population of about 50,000, a native population of about 400,000,
and an Indian population of about 51,000, according to the latest
census. The 51,000 Indians include 30,000 free Indians, i.e., those that
have finished their indentured service and are engaged in the Colony
in various pursuits of life as household servants, petty farmers,
vegetable hawkers, fruiterers, goldsmiths, artisans, petty storekeepers,
schoolmasters, photographers, attorneys’ clerks, etc., 16,000 who are
at present serving their indenture, and 5,000 traders who came to the
Colony on their own means and are either traders or shopkeepers’
assistants, the trade consisting in soft goods suitable to the natives of
South Africa, called Zulus or Kaffirs, hardware, soft goods and
groceries suitable to the Indian population. The soft goods and
groceries for the Indians are imported from Bombay, Calcutta and
Madras. The free and indentured Indians come from Madras and
Calcutta and are pretty equally divided. Indian emigration was
resorted to when, as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Natal,
Mr* Garland, says, “the existence of the Colony hung in the
balance”. The terms of the contract briefly are that the indentured
man has to serve his employer for a period of 5 years, the monthly
wages for the first year being £10

3 every

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 393, 1, 6, 912933) The soft goods and groceries for the Indians are imported from Bombay, Calcutta and Madras.

FIRST   GRIEVANCE   IN   NATAL  —  FRANCHISE
The Royal Charter, dated the 15th July, 1850, provides that any
adult male, not being a native of South Africa, possessing property to
the value of £50 or who rents any such property of the yearly value of
£10, shall be entitled to be placed on the Voters’ Roll. There is a
separate law governing the Native Franchise which requires, among
other things, 12 years residence on the part of the native in a
particular electoral district and exemption from the native law of the
Colony.
Under the general franchise law of the Colony, i.e., the Royal
Charter referred to above, the Indians as British subjects enjoyed full
electoral rights till after 1893* In 1894, in the Second Parliament
under the Responsible Government, an Act was passed, No. 25 of
1894, disqualifying persons of Asiatic extraction from having their
names inserted in any Voters’ List, exempting those whose names
were then already rightly contained in any Voters’ List. The preamble
of the Act stated that such persons were not accustomed to the
Franchise rights.
The real reason for passing such an Act was to lower the status
of the Indian and gradually to bring him down to the level of the
South African natives so that, in time to come, the respectable Indian
may become an impossibility. A petition was presented to the
Legislative Assembly combating the view that the Indians were not
accustomed to representative institutions and asking for the withdrawal
of the Bill, or an enquiry as to whether or not the Indians were fit to
exercise the franchise. (Enclosure I, App. A)

New Para:  The question now put before Mr* Chamberlain is not an academic one.
It is not a question of argument but of race feeling. We cannot afford a war of
races among our own subjects. It would be as wrong for the Government of
India to suddenly arrest the development of Natal by shutting all the supply of
immigrants as it would be for Natal to deny the right of citizenship to British
Indian subjects who, by years of thrift and good work in the Colony, have
raised themselves to the actual status of citizens. (London Times, 27th June,
1896).
This article deals with the various arguments brought forward
by the Colonists in support of disfranchisement of the Indians and
shows that there is no question of swamping the European electors,
because, out of nearly 10,000 electors, according to latest  lists
published, there are only 251 Indian electors and that there are very
few Indians in the Colony who can command the necessary property
qualifications (see Enclosure V
1). The present Bill is meant merely to
harass the Indian community and to involve them in endless litigation.

says that, although personally he regrets that such a course should be
desired by the Colonists, subject to the approval of the Home

understanding that the breach of the clause about compulsory return
should never become a criminal offence. (Enclosure V*)
On the lines of the report of the Commission that visited India,
the Natal Government, in the year 1895, introduced the Indian
Immigration Law Amendment Bill, which provides, amongst other
things, for the indefinite period of indenture or the compulsory return
of the immigrants, and further provides that any such immigrant
failing to enter into the further terms of indenture or to return to India
shall be liable to take out an annual licence costing £3 yearly. Thus it
would appear that this Bill goes further than the terms laid down in the
Viceroy’s despatch above alluded to. Memorials

both the Houses in Natal taking exception to this Bill but to no
purpose. (Enclosure V, App. A and B*) A memorial has also been
addressed to Mr* Chamberlain as well as to the Indian Government
praying either that the Bill should be disallowed or that further Indian
immigration to Natal should be stopped. (Enclosure VI.)
2 These
prayers have been strongly supported by the London Times in a
leading article dated 3-5-95 [96?].
Over ten years ago, a Commission was appointed by the then
Governor of Natal to report upon various matters connected with
Indian immigration. Evidence has been cited from this report to show
that, at that time, the Commissioners as well as the best men of the day,
including the present Attorney-General, thought that any such
measure would be a cruel wrong to the Indians and a disgrace to the
British name.

THIRD   GRIEVANCE  — THE   CURFEW
There is a Law in Natal (No. 15 of 1869), which provides that,
in the boroughs, no ‘coloured person’, unless he can give a good
account of himself or unless he can produce a pass from his
employer, shall be out at night after 9 o’clock. This Law is, perhaps,
not absolutely unnecessary, but its working is often oppressive.
Respectable Indians, such as schoolmasters and others, have often
been locked up in horrible dungeons for having ventured out after 9
p.m., no matter on what business.
FOURTH   GRIEVANCE  — THE   PASS  LAW
The Law provides that every Indian can be asked to produce a
pass. It is really meant to detect indentured Indians who have deserted
their masters, but is also used as an engine of oppression towards the
Indians generally. The Indian community in Natal have not yet
moved with regard to the last two matters, but they may be brought
under the general grievances and can be used to show the tendency of
the Colonists to make it as uncomfortable as possible for the Indians
in Natal. As for the working of these two Laws, see Enclosure III, pp.

This country is a Crown Colony governed by the Governor of
Natal in the Queen’s name. The Natal ministry or the Governor of
Natal as such has nothing to do with Zululand. There is a small
European and a large native (Kaffir) population in it. There are
townships established in Zululand. The township of Melmoth was the
first to be established. In that township, in the year 1888, the Indians
bought erven, i.e., specified pieces of land, worth about £2,000* The
township of Eshowe was proclaimed in 1891 and that of Nondweni in
1896* The regulations for the purchase of erven in both these
township are the same and they provide that only persons of
European birth and descent shall be approved of as occupiers of erven

New Para:  A memorial
1 protesting against these regulations was presented
to the Governor of Zululand last February, who declined to interfere.
Thereupon a memorial
2 was sent to Mr* Chamberlain, and the
question is now engaging his attention. These regulations, it will be
noticed, go much further than what the Colonists in the self-governing
Colonies have been allowed to do, and follow the policy of total
exclusion adopted by the Orange Free State.
Zululand gold mining laws make it criminal for an Indian to
buy or possess native gold.
CAPE    COLONY
The Colony of the Cape of Good Hope is, like the Colony of
Natal, a responsibly governed Colony with a Constitution similar to
Natal’s. Only, the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council
contain a greater number of members, and the franchise qualifications
are different, viz., the property qualification is occupation for 12
months of a building worth £75, the salary qualification is £50 per
annum. The person claiming to be registered must be able to sign his
name and write his address and occupation. This Act was passed in
1892 and was really passed to check the Indian and the Malay vote.
There would be no objection on the part of the Indian community to
such 
educational 
qualifications 
being 
imposed 
or 
property
qualifications being increased in Natal. This Colony contains an area
of 276,320 square miles and a total population of about 1,800,000
persons, of whom not more than 400,000 are Europeans. The Indian
population of the Colony would be roughly 10,000, consisting of
traders, hawkers and labourers. They are to be found chiefly in the
ports, viz., Port Elizabeth, East London and Cape Town and also in the
mines in Kimberley.
All the information relating to the disabilities placed on the
Indians is not available. In 1894, the Parliament passed a Bill
authorizing the East London Municipality to frame bye-laws
prohibiting the Indians from walking on the foot-paths and
compelling them to live in specified locations. No 
special
representation on this head has been made to Mr* Chamberlain from
South Africa. But the matter was  touched upon by the Indian
deputation that waited upon Mr* Chamberlain last year.

New Para:  In the various parts or districts of the Cape Colony, it is
extremely difficult for an Indian to get trading licences. In many
cases the magistrates simply refuse the licences, declining to give
reasons for so doing. The Magistrates are within their rights in
declining to give reasons, but it has been found almost invariably that
the licences have been granted to Europeans when they have been
withheld from the Indian. The following is the position of the Indians
in East Griqualand, a district in the Cape Colony, according to The
Natal Mercury dated 3rd March, 1896:

customs duty upon goods and applied for a licence which the magistrate
refused. Mr* Attorney Francis on the Arab’s behalf (as the Indians are
sometimes called in South Africa) appealed to the Cape Government, who
upheld the Magistrate and have issued instructions that no coolies or Arabs
are to have trading licences in East Griqualand and one or two that have

About 100 Indian waiters and labourers have settled there. A few
traders have also gone, but they are refused licences to trade, in the
first instance. The law being in favour of the Indians, one enterprising
Indian last year succeeded in securing a trading licence through the
Superior Court at Cape Town.
The Europeans in the Chartered Territories have now applied
for an alteration of the law so that the Indians may, henceforth, be
prevented from getting trading licences in those territories. The
newspapers in South Africa say that the Cape Government favour such
an alteration.

families to enter, travel or reside in any part of the Transvaal State. They will
be entitled to hire or possess houses, manufactories, warehouses, shops,

agents they may think fit to employ. They will not be subject, in respect of
their persons and property, in respect of their commerce and industry, to any
taxes, whether general, or local, other than those which are or may be
imposed upon the Transvaal citizens.
This Convention, thus, completely secures the trading and
property rights of British Indian. In January 1885, the Transvaal
Government wanted so to interpret the word “natives”, occurring in
the Art. 14 of the Convention, as to include Asiatics. Sir Hercules
Robinson, the then High Commissioner for South Africa, after
consultation with Sir Henry de Villiers, the Chief Justice of the
Colony, considered that the interpretation put upon the word
“native” by the Transvaal Government could not be sustained and
“that Asiatics were persons other than natives”.

favourably  disposed towards the Transvaal Government and, in
response to his suggestion, received the following reply from Lord
Derby

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 402, 1, 3, 933278) Sir Hercules Robinson was favourably disposed towards the Transvaal Government and, in response to his suggestion, received the following reply from Lord Derby 1 under date 19th March 1885:
New Para:  I have carefully considered your suggestion as to the amendment of the
Convention, and if you are of opinion that it would be preferable and more
satisfactory to the Government of the South African Republic to proceed as
you propose, Her Majesty’s Government will be willing to amend the
Convention as suggested. It seems to deserve consideration, however,
whether it would be more correct for the Volksraad to legislate in the proposed
sense, having received an assurance that Her Majesty’s Government will not
desire to insist upon any such construction of the terms of the Convention as
would interfere with reasonable legislation in the desired direction.
In accordance with Lord Derby’s suggestion, the Transvaal
Volksraad passed bye-law No. 3 of 1885, which applies to all Indians
and other coloured people, and provides  that none of them could
obtain the franchise, that they could not be owners of fixed property,
that such coloured people, who settle in the Republic for the purpose
of trading, must be separately registered within 8 days after the day of
their arrival and that they should pay a registration fee of £25* Any
contravention of this law subjects the defaulter to a fine of from £30
to £100 or, in default, from 1 to 6 months’ imprisonment. It also
provides that the Government shall have the right to point out to such
coloured people streets, wards and locations for habitation. In 1886,
this law was amended so as to reduce the £25 fee to £3 and the other
sections were kept as they were. That now is the law with regard to the
Indians in the Transvaal. After the law was passed, the Indians sent
representations, telegraphic and otherwise, to the Indian and the Home
Governments protesting against the Law 3 of 1885 and its amendment
and pointing out that they were in direct violation of the London
Convention. This brought out some representations from Lord
Knutsford
2 on behalf of the Indians. There has been voluminous
correspondence between the two Governments with regard to the
interpretation of the word ‘habitation’. The Home Government
insisted that the word ‘habitation’ meant residence only. The
Transvaal Government insisted that it included not only residence but

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 402, 2, 5, 933781) It seems to deserve consideration, however, whether it would be more correct for the Volksraad to legislate in the proposed sense, having received an assurance that Her Majesty’s Government will not desire to insist upon any such construction of the terms of the Convention as would interfere with reasonable legislation in the desired direction.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 402, 2, 6, 934128) In accordance with Lord Derby’s suggestion, the Transvaal Volksraad passed bye-law No.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 402, 2, 7, 934215) 3 of 1885, which applies to all Indians and other coloured people, and provides that none of them could obtain the franchise, that they could not be owners of fixed property, that such coloured people, who settle in the Republic for the purpose of trading, must be separately registered within 8 days after the day of their arrival and that they should pay a registration fee of £25. Any contravention of this law subjects the defaulter to a fine of from £30 to £100 or, in default, from 1 to 6 months’ imprisonment.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 402, 2, 8, 934732) It also provides that the Government shall have the right to point out to such coloured people streets, wards and locations for habitation.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 402, 2, 9, 934872) In 1886, this law was amended so as to reduce the £25 fee to £3 and the other sections were kept as they were.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 402, 2, 10, 934983) That now is the law with regard to the Indians in the Transvaal.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 402, 2, 11, 935048) After the law was passed, the Indians sent representations, telegraphic and otherwise, to the Indian and the Home Governments protesting against the Law 3 of 1885 and its amendment and pointing out that they were in direct violation of the London Convention.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 402, 2, 12, 935307) This brought out some representations from Lord Knutsford 2 on behalf of the Indians.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 402, 2, 14, 935522) The Home Government insisted that the word ‘habitation’ meant residence only.

New Para:  “confusion worse confounded”, and it was agreed between the two
Governments that the question of the validity of the Law 3 of 1885
and its amendment, as also interpretation, should be submitted to
arbitration. The Chief Justice of the Orange Free State was selected as
the sole arbitrator who gave his award last year and decided that the
Transvaal Government was justified in passing Law 3 of 1885 and its
amendments, but he left undecided the question of interpretation and
held that, if the parties could not agree to interpretation, the Courts of
the Transvaal were the proper tribunals to decide that question.
(Enclosure VIII.)
The Indians in the Transvaal sent memorials
1 to the Home and
Indian Governments. Mr* Chamberlain has given his decision and has
reluctantly accepted the award of the arbitrator, but sympathizes with
the Indians and terms them “a peaceable, law-abiding, meritorious
body of persons” whose undoubted industry, intelligence and
indomitable perseverance perhaps will suffice to overcome any
obstacles which may now face them in the pursuit of their avocations,
and reserves to himself the liberty, later on, to make friendly
representations to the Transvaal Government.
The question rests there at present. Although the award has
been accepted, it will have been seen from what has preceded that
there are many questions still undecided. Where will the Indians be
now in the Transvaal? Will their stores be closed up? If so, what will
200 or 300 traders do to earn a living? Will they have to trade also in
locations? This, however, does not complete the list of disabilities in
the Transvaal.

Southern Africa that this question of their status must be determined. If they
secure the position of British subjects in South Africa, it would be almost
impossible to deny it to them elsewhere. If they fail to secure that position in

New Para:  immigration of Indians of India. I, therefore, humbly venture to think
that this question should be, if it is not already, one of the questions of
the day in India. With these preliminary remarks, I shall now place
before you, as shortly as possible, the whole position of affairs in
South Africa as affecting the British Indians in that country.
 
South Africa, for our present purposes, is divided into the
following States: the British Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, the
British Colony of Natal, the British Colony of Zululand, the Transvaal
or the South African Republic, the Orange Free State, the Chartered
Territories or Rhodesia, and the Portuguese Territories of Delagoa
Bay and Beira.
In South Africa, apart from the Portuguese Territories, there are
nearly 100,000 Indians, of whom the greater part belong to the
labouring class, drawn from the labouring population of Madras and
Bengal, speaking the Tamil or Telugu and the Hindi languages
respectively. A small number belongs to the trading class, chiefly
drawn from the Bombay Presidency. A general feeling throughout
South Africa is that of hatred towards Indian, encouraged by the
newspapers and connived at, even countenanced by, the legislators.
Every Indian, without exception, is a coolie in the estimation of the
general body of the Europeans. Storekeepers are “coolie store-
keepers”. Indian clerks and schoolmasters are “coolie clerks” and
“coolie schoolmasters”. Naturally, neither the traders nor the
English-educated Indians are treated with any degree of respect.
Wealth and abilities in an Indian count for naught in that country
except to serve the interests of the European Colonists. We are the
“Asian dirt to be heartily cursed”. We are “squalid coolies with
truthless tongues”. We are “the real canker that is eating into the very
vitals of the community”. We are “parasites, semi-barbarous
Asiatics”. We “live upon rice and we are chock-full of vice”. Statute-
books describe the Indians as belonging to the “aboriginal or semi-
barbarous races of Asia”, while, as a matter of fact, there is hardly one
Indian in South Africa belonging to the aboriginal stock. The
Santhals of Assam will be as useless in South Africa as the natives of
that country. The Pretoria Chamber of Commerce thinks that our
religion teaches us to “consider all women as soulless and Christians a
natural prey”. According to the same authority, “the whole
community in South Africa is exposed to the dangers engendered by
the filthy habits and immoral practices of these people.” Yet, as a

amongst the Indians in South Africa. And Dr* Veale of Pretoria thinks
that “the  lowest class Indians live better and in better habitations and
with more regard to sanitation than the lowest class Whites”, and he,
furthermore, puts on record that “while every nationality had one or
more of its members at some time in the lazaretto, there was not a
single Indian attacked.”
In most parts of South Africa, we may not stir out of our houses
after 9 p.m.— unless we are armed with passes from our employer.
An exception, however, is made in favour of those Indians who wear
the memon costume. Hotels shut their doors against us. We cannot
make use of the tram-cars unmolested. The coaches are not for us.
Between Barberton and Pretoria in the Transvaal, and Johannesburg
and Charlestown, when the latter were not connected by railway, the
Indians, as a rule, are and were not allowed to sit inside the coaches,
but are and were compelled to take their seats by the side of the
driver. This, on a frosty morning in the Transvaal, where winter is very
severe, is a sore trial apart from the indignity which it involves. The
coach-travelling involves long journeys and, at stated intervals,
accommodation and food are provided for passengers. No Indian is
allowed accommodation or a seat at the dining table in these places.
At the most, he can purchase food from behind the kitchen-room and
manage the best way he can. Instances of untold miseries suffered by
the Indians can be quoted by hundreds. Public baths are not for the
Indians. The high schools are not open to the Indians. A fortnight
before I left Natal, an Indian student applied for admission to the
Durban High School and his application was rejected. Even the
primary schools are not quite open to the Indians. An Indian
Missionary schoolmaster was driven out of an English Church in
Verulam, a small village in Natal. The Government of Natal have been
pining to hold a “coolie conference”, as it has been officially called,
in order to secure uniformity in Indian legislation throughout South
Africa, and in order to present a united front against the
blandishments of the Home Government on behalf of the Indian.
Such is the general feeling against the Indian in South Africa, except
the Portuguese Territories, where he is respected and has no grievance
apart from the general population. You can easily imagine how
difficult it must be for a respectable Indian to exist in such a country.

a first-class railway carriage in Natal, and, after reaching Volksrust, he
would be put out unceremoniously from his first-class compartment
and accommodated in a tin compartment where Kaffirs are packed
like sheep. I may, however, assure him that if he ever came to South
Africa, and we wish our great men did come to these uncomfortable
quarters, if only to see and realize the plight in which their fellow-
countrymen are, we shall more than make up 
for 
these
inconveniences, which we cannot help, by according him a right royal
welcome, so united, so enthusiastic we are, at any rate for the present.
Ours is one continual struggle against a degradation sought to be
inflicted upon us by the Europeans, who desire to degrade us to the
level of the raw Kaffir whose occupation is hunting, and whose sole
ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with and,
then, pass his life in indolence and nakedness. The aim of the
Christian Governments, so we read, is to raise people whom they come
in contact with or whom they control. It is otherwise in South Africa.
There, the deliberately expressed object is not to allow the Indian to
rise higher in the scale of civilization but to lower him to the position
of the Kaffir; in the words of the Attorney-General of Natal, “to keep
him for ever a hewer of wood and drawer of water”, “not to let him
form part of the future South African nation that is going to be
built”; in the words of another legislator in Natal, “to make the
Indian’s life more comfortable in his native land than in the Colony
of Natal”. The struggle against such degradation is so severe that our
whole energy is spent in resistance. Consequently, we have very little
left in us to attempt to make any reforms from within.
I must now come to the particular States and show how the
Governments in the different States have combined with the masses to
persecute the Indians to make “the British Indian an impossibility”.
The Colony of Natal, which is a self-governing British Colony with a
Legislative Assembly consisting of 37 members elected by the voters,
and a Legislative Council consisting of twelve members nominated by

400,000, and an Indian population of 51,000* Assisted immigration of

30,000 are those that have served out their indenture and are now
variously engaged as free labourers, gardeners, hawkers, fruiterers, or
petty traders. A few have, also, by their industry, educated themselves
into fitness for the posts of schoolmasters, interpreters and general
clerks in spite of adverse circumstances; 16,000 are at present serving
their indenture, and about 5,000 are traders and merchants or their
assistants who came first on their own means. These latter belong to

But they are coolie ship-owners and their ships are called “coolie

Apart from the common interest that every Indian feels in every
other Indian, the three chief Presidencies are specially interested in
this question. If the Bombay Presidency has not sent an equally large
number of her sons to South Africa, she makes up for that by the
greater influence and wealth of her sons who have really constituted
themselves the guardians of the interests of their less fortunate
brethren from the sister Presidencies. And it may be that in India also
Bombay will lead in endeavouring to help the Indians in South Africa
out of their hardships.

New Para:  the Indians different from that accorded to the Europeans. This was
patent not only from the speeches made by the members on the
second reading of the Bill but also from the newspapers. They also
said it was expedient to disfranchise the Indian under the plea that the
Indian vote might swamp the European. But even this plea is and was
untenable. In 1891, there were only 251 Indian voters as against
nearly 10,000 European voters. The majority of Indians are too poor
to command property qualifications. And the Indians in Natal have
never meddled in politics and do not want political power. All these
facts are admitted by The Natal Mercury, which is the Government
organ in Natal. I must refer you to my little pamphlet
1 published in
India for corroborative extracts. We memorialized the local Parliament
and showed that the Indians were not unacquainted with the
representative institutions. We were, however, unsuccessful. We then
memorialized Lord Ripon, the then Secretary of State of the Colonies.
After two years’ correspondence, the Bill of 1894 was withdrawn this
year and has been replaced by another which, while not so bad as the
once repealed, is bad enough. It provides that “the natives or
descendants, in the male line, of natives of countries which have not
hitherto possessed elective representative institutions founded on the
parliamentary franchise, shall not be placed on any Voters’ List unless
they shall first obtain an order from the Governor-in-Council
exempting them from the operation of the Act.” It also exempts from
its operation those persons that are rightly contained in any Voters’
List. This Bill was submitted to Mr* Chamberlain for approval before
being introduced in the Legislative Assembly. In the papers published,
Mr* Chamberlain seems to be of opinion that India does not possess
elective representative institutions founded on the parliamentary
franchise. With the greatest deference to these views, we submitted to
Mr* Chamberlain in a memorial, for we did not succeed before the
Natal Parliament, that for the purposes of the Bill, that is, legally
speaking, India did and does possess elective representative institutions
founded on the parliamentary franchise. Such is the opinion
expressed by the London Times, such is the opinion of the newspapers
in Natal and such is also the opinion of the members who voted for
the Bill, as also of an able jurist in Natal. We are very anxious to know
the opinion of the legal luminaries here. The object in passing such a
Bill is to play a game of ‘Toss up’ to harass the Indian community.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 3, 955366) This was patent not only from the speeches made by the members on the second reading of the Bill but also from the newspapers.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 4, 955493) They also said it was expedient to disfranchise the Indian under the plea that the Indian vote might swamp the European.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 5, 955614) But even this plea is and was untenable.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 6, 955655) In 1891, there were only 251 Indian voters as against nearly 10,000 European voters.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 7, 955740) The majority of Indians are too poor to command property qualifications.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 8, 955813) And the Indians in Natal have never meddled in politics and do not want political power.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 9, 955902) All these facts are admitted by The Natal Mercury, which is the Government organ in Natal.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 10, 955993) I must refer you to my little pamphlet 1 published in India for corroborative extracts.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 11, 956081) We memorialized the local Parliament and showed that the Indians were not unacquainted with the representative institutions.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 12, 956206) We were, however, unsuccessful.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 13, 956238) We then memorialized Lord Ripon, the then Secretary of State of the Colonies.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 14, 956316) After two years’ correspondence, the Bill of 1894 was withdrawn this year and has been replaced by another which, while not so bad as the once repealed, is bad enough.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 15, 956484) It provides that “the natives or descendants, in the male line, of natives of countries which have not hitherto possessed elective representative institutions founded on the parliamentary franchise, shall not be placed on any Voters’ List unless they shall first obtain an order from the Governor-in-Council exempting them from the operation of the Act.” It also exempts from its operation those persons that are rightly contained in any Voters’ List.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 16, 956936) This Bill was submitted to Mr. Chamberlain for approval before being introduced in the Legislative Assembly.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 17, 957045) In the papers published, Mr. Chamberlain seems to be of opinion that India does not possess elective representative institutions founded on the parliamentary franchise.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 18, 957214) With the greatest deference to these views, we submitted to Mr. Chamberlain in a memorial, for we did not succeed before the Natal Parliament, that for the purposes of the Bill, that is, legally speaking, India did and does possess elective representative institutions founded on the parliamentary franchise.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 411, 1, 19, 957523) Such is the opinion expressed by the London Times, such is the opinion of the newspapers in Natal and such is also the opinion of the members who voted for the Bill, as also of an able jurist in Natal.

New Para:  Many members of the Natal Assembly, otherwise hostile to the Indian,
thought that the Bill would involve the Indian community in endless
litigation and cause a ferment among them.
 
The Government organ says in effect: “We can have this Bill
and no other. If we succeed, that is, if India is declared a country not
possessing the institutions referred to in the Bill, well and good. If not,
then, too, we lose nothing. We shall try another, we shall raise the
property qualification and impose an educational test. If such a Bill is
objected to, even then we need not be afraid, for, where is the cause?
We know that the Indians can never swamp us.” If I had the time, I
could give you the exact words which are much stronger. Those who
take a special interest can look them up from the Green Pamphlet.
Thus, then, we are a proper subject for vivisection under their Natal
Pasteur’s deadly scalpel and knife. The only difference is that the
Paris Pasteur did it with a view to do good. Our Natal Pasteur does it
for the sake of amusement to be derived from the operation out of
sheer wantonness. This memorial is now under consideration by Mr*
Chamberlain.
I cannot lay too much stress on the fact that the position in
India is entirely different from the position in Natal. Eminent men in
India have asked me the question, “Why do you want the franchise in
Natal when you have only a visionary franchise in India, if, at all?”
Our humble reply is that in Natal it is not we who want the franchise, it
is the Europeans who want to deprive us of the right we have been
enjoying in Natal. That makes all the difference. The deprivation will
involve degradation. There is no such thing in India. The
representative institutions in India are slowly, but surely, being
liberalized. Such institutions are being gradually closed against us in
Natal. Again, as the London Times puts it, “The Indian in India has
precisely the same franchise as the Englishman enjoys.” Not so in
Natal. What is sauce for the European goose is not sauce for the
Indian gander there. Moreover, the disfranchising in Natal is not a
political move but a merely commercial policy—a policy adopted to
check the immigration of the respectable Indian. Being a British
subject, he should be able to claim the same privileges as the other
British subjects enjoy in a certain British State or Colony, just as an
Indian going to England would be able to avail himself of the
institutions of England to as full an extent as any Englishman. The
fact, however, is that there is no fear of the Indian vote swamping the

New Para:  European; what they want is class legislation. The class legislation with
regard to franchise is only the thin end of the wedge. They
contemplate depriving the Indians of the Municipal franchise also. A
statement to that effect was made by the  Attorney-General, in reply to
the suggestion made by a member that the Indians should be deprived
of the municipal franchise, too, at the time the first Franchise Bill was
introduced. Another member suggested that, while they were dealing
with the Indian question, Civil Service in the Colony should be closed
to the Indians.
In the Cape Colony also, which has a Government exactly
similar to Natal’s, the condition of the Indians is growing worse.
Lately, the Cape Parliament has passed a Bill which authorizes the East
London Municipality to frame bye-laws prohibiting Indians from
walking on the footpaths and compelling them to live in specific
locations which, as a rule, are unhealthy swamps unfit for human
habitation and certainly useless for purposes of trade. In Zululand, a
Crown Colony and, therefore, directly under the control of the Home
Government, regulations have been passed with regard to the
townships of Nondweni and Eshowe to the effect that the Indians
cannot own or acquire land in those townships, although, in that of
Melmoth in the same country, the Indians own property worth £2,000*
In the Transvaal, which is a Dutch Republic, the seat of the Jameson
Raid and the El Dorado of the gold-hunters of the Western World,
there are over 5,000 Indians, many of whom are merchants and
storekeepers. Others are hawkers, waiters and household servants. The
Convention
1 between the Home Government and the Transvaal
Government secures the trading and property rights of “all persons
other than natives” and under it the Indians were trading freely up to
1885* In that year, however, after some correspondence with the
Home Government, the Transvaal Volksraad passed a law which took
away from the Indians the right of trading, except in specified
locations, and owning landed property, and imposed a registration fee
of £3 on every Indian intending to settle in that country. I must again
beg to refer the curious to the Green Pamphlet for the whole history
of the protracted negotiations which culminated in the matter being
entrusted to an arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator being

complaint of the Indians has been fully admitted. The system of
passes prevails in the Transvaal in a very cruel form. While, in other
parts of South Africa, it is the railway officials who make the lot of the
1st and 2nd class passengers on the railway intolerable, the Transvaal
people have gone one better in that there the law prohibits the Indians
from travelling 1st or 2nd class. They are, irrespective of position,
huddled together in the same compartment with the natives of South
Africa. The Gold Mining laws make it criminal for the Indians to buy
native gold. And if the Transvaal Government are allowed to have
their own way, they would, while treating them as mere chattels,
compel the Indians to render military service. The thing is monstrous
on the face of it, for, as the London Times puts it, “we might now see
a levy of British Indian subjects driven at the point of the Transvaal
bayonets against the bayonets of British troops.” The Orange Free
State, the other Dutch Republic in South Africa, beats the record in
showing its hatred towards Indians. It has, to put it in the words of its
chief organ, simply made the “British Indian an impossibility by
classing him with the Kaffir”. It denies the Indian the right not only
to trade, farm or own landed property, but even to reside there, except
under special, insulting circumstances.
Such, very shortly, is the position of the Indians in the various
States in South Africa. The same Indian, who is so much hated in the
various States above mentioned, is very much liked and respected only
300 miles from Natal, i.e., in Delagoa Bay. The real cause of all this
prejudice may be expressed in the words of the leading organ in
South Africa, namely, the Cape Times, when it was under the
editorship of the prince of South African journalists, Mr* St* Leger:

New Para:  If this was true in 1889, when the above was written, it is doubly
so now, because the Legislatures of South Africa have shown
phenomenal activity in passing measures restricting the liberty of the
Queen’s Indian subjects.
 
To stem the tide of this opposition against us, we have formed
an organization
1 on an humble scale so that we may take the necessary
steps to have our grievances removed. We believe that much of the ill-
feeling is due to want of proper knowledge about the Indians in India.
We, therefore, endeavour, so far as the populace is concerned, to
educate public opinion by imparting the necessary information. With
regard to the legal disabilities, we have tried to influence the English
public opinion in England and the public opinion here by placing our
position before it. As you know, both the Conservatives and the
Liberals have supported us in England without distinction. The
London Times has given eight leading articles to our cause in a very
sympathetic spirit.
2 This alone has raised us a step higher in the
estimation of the Europeans in South Africa, and has considerably
affected for the better the tone of the newspapers there.
I may state our position a little more clearly as to our demands.
We are aware that the insults and indignities, that we are subjected to at
the hands of the populace, cannot be directly removed by the
intervention of the Home Government. We do not appeal to it for any
such intervention. We bring them to the notice of the public, so that
the fair-minded of all communities and the Press may, by expressing
their disapproval, materially reduce their rigour and, possibly,
eradicate them ultimately. But we certainly do appeal, and we hope
not vainly, to the Home Government for protection against
reproduction of such ill-feeling in Colonial legislation. We certainly
beseech the Home Government to disallow all the Acts of the
Legislative bodies of the Colonies restricting our freedom in any
shape or form.
And this brings me to the last question, namely, how far can the
Home Government interfere with such action on the part of the
Colonies and the allied States. As for Zululand, there can be no
question, since it is a Crown Colony directly governed from Downing
Street through a Governor. It is not a self-governing or responsibly-
governed Colony as the Colonies of Natal and the Cape of Good
Hope are. With regard to the latter, Clause 7 of the Constitution Act of
Natal enacts that Her Majesty may disallow any Act of the local

received the Governor’s assent. That is one safeguard against
oppressive measures by the    Colonies.  The Royal instructions to the
Governor enumerate certain Bills which cannot be assented to by the
Governor without Her Majesty’s previous sanction. Among such are
Bills which have for their object class legislation. I shall venture to
give an instance in point. The Immigration Law Amendment Bill
referred to above has been assented to by the Governor, but it can
come into force only after her Majesty has sanctioned it. It has not yet
been sanctioned. Thus, then, it will be noticed that Her Majesty’s
intervention is direct and precise. While it is true that the Home
Government is slow to interfere with the Acts of the Colonial
Legislatures, there are instances where it has not hesitated to put its
foot down on occasions less urgent then the present one. As you are
aware, the repeal of the first Franchise Bill was due to such wholesome
intervention. What is more, Colonists are ever afraid of it. And as a
result of the sympathy expressed in England and the sympathetic
answer given by Mr* Chamberlain to the deputation that waited on
him some months ago, most of the papers in South Africa, at any rate
in Natal, have veered round or think that the Immigration and other
such Bills will not receive the Royal assent. As to the Transvaal there is
the Convention. As to the Orange Free State, I can only say that it is
an unfriendly act on the part of a friendly State to shut her doors
against any portion of Her Majesty’s subjects. And as such, I humbly
think it can be effectively checked.
Gentlemen, the latest advice from South Africa show that the
Europeans there are actively canvassing the ruin of the Indians. They
are agitating against the introduction of Indian artisans and what not.

I am sure you would be good enough to excuse me for my
inability to write to you earlier and send you the names of the chief
men of South Africa. The reason is that I have been very busy with
domestic business. I am writing this at midnight.
I leave for Madras by tomorrow evening’s Mail (Sunday). I
expect to stay there not more than a fortnight. If I am successful there
I would thence proceed to Calcutta and return to Bombay within a
month from today. I would then take the first boat to Natal.
The latest papers received from Natal show that there is still
much fight ahead. And that alone is sufficient to absorb the attention
of two men of your activity if full justice is to be done to the cause. I
sincerely hope that you will be able to see your way clear to join me
in Natal. I am sure it is a cause worth fighting for.
If you wish to write to me you may write to me at the above
address and your letters will be redirected to me at Madras. I do not
know at which hotel I shall put up there. The Natal hotels have made
me quite nervous.
I remain,
Yours truly,

New Para:  SIR,
I shall be obliged to you if you will be good enough to find
space for the following in your influential paper.
The Natal Agent-General has, it appears, told Reuter, with
reference to my pamphlet on the grievances of the British Indians in
South Africa, that it is not true to say that the railway and tramway
officials treat the Indians as beasts, that the fact that the indentured
Indians do not avail themselves of the return passage is the best answer
to my pamphlet, and that the Indians are not denied justice in the law-
courts. In the first place, the pamphlet deals with the grievances of the
Indians in the whole of South Africa. In the second place, I adhere to
the statement that the railway and tram-car official treat the Indians as
beasts in Natal. If there are exceptions, they prove the rule. I have
been witness myself to not a few such cases. What is it if it is not being
treated as a beast, to be removed three times during a single night
journey from one compartment to another, to suit European
passengers? To see Indians, apparently respectable, kicked, pushed,
and sworn at by the  station-master is not an extraordinary sight on
the railway stations. The Western station in Durban is the dread of the
Indians, so over-polite is the station-master at that station, and this is
not the only station where the Indians are kicked about like footballs.
Here is an independent testimony from The Natal Mercury

New Para:  On our railway, we have noticed on more than one occasion that
coloured passengers are not by any means killed with civility; and, although
it would be unreasonable to expect that the White employees of the N.G.R*
should treat them with the same deference as is accorded to European
passengers, still, we think it would be in no way derogatory to their dignity if
the officials were a little more suaviter in modo when dealing with the
coloured travellers.

New Para:  another to suit the fancy of European passengers. Indeed, as a rule,
the tram-car officials compel “Sammy” to go “upstairs”. Some
would not allow them to take front seats. Respect is out of the
question. An Indian official was compelled to stand on the tram-car
board, although there was ample room to accommodate him. Of
course, he was addressed as “Sammy” in the peculiarly offensive
tone prevalent in Natal.
My  statement has been before the public in Natal for the last
two years, and the first contradiction comes now from the Agent-
General! Why so late? As to the unwillingness of the Indians to avail
themselves of the return passage, I beg to say, with due deference to
the Agent-General, that the statement has been repeated ad nauseam
in the Press, and the official dignity now given to it will not enable it
to prove more than it actually can. At the most it can prove that the lot
of the indentured Indian cannot be very unhappy; and that Natal is a
very good place for such Indians to earn their livelihood. I am
prepared to admit both. That does not, moreover, disprove the
existence of the Colonial legislation restricting the freedom of the
Indians in various ways. That does not disprove the existence of the
terrible ill-feeling towards the Indians in the Colony. If the Indians
remain in Natal, it is in spite of such treatment. It proves their
marvellous forbearance, which has been so eloquently praised by Mr*
Chamberlain in his despatch in connection with, to use a South
African phrase, “the coolie arbitration”.

the Natal Government, lend additional weight to my statement that the
Indian is a cruelly persecuted being in South Africa. In August last,
there was a meeting of European artisans, held to protest against the
intended introduction of Indian artisans. The speeches made would
form interesting reading for the Agent-General of Natal. The Indians
were called “black vermin”. A voice in the meeting said, “We will go
to the Point1 and stop them.” A picnic party of European children
used Indian and Kaffir boys as targets and shot bullets into their faces,
hurting several inoffensive children. So deep-seated is the hatred that
children have begun instinctively to look down upon Indians.
Moreover, it should be remembered that the return passage story has
nothing to do with the trading class, who go to Natal on their own
account, and who feel the hardships the most. The thing is, one fact is
stronger than a hundred statements of belief. And the pamphlet

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 3, 976359) Indeed, as a rule, the tram-car officials compel “Sammy” to go “upstairs”.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 4, 976434) Some would not allow them to take front seats.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 5, 976481) Respect is out of the question.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 6, 976513) An Indian official was compelled to stand on the tram-car board, although there was ample room to accommodate him.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 7, 976628) Of course, he was addressed as “Sammy” in the peculiarly offensive tone prevalent in Natal.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 8, 976720) My statement has been before the public in Natal for the last two years, and the first contradiction comes now from the Agent- General!
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 9, 976856) Why so late?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 10, 976869) As to the unwillingness of the Indians to avail themselves of the return passage, I beg to say, with due deference to the Agent-General, that the statement has been repeated ad nauseam in the Press, and the official dignity now given to it will not enable it to prove more than it actually can.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 11, 977164) At the most it can prove that the lot of the indentured Indian cannot be very unhappy; and that Natal is a very good place for such Indians to earn their livelihood.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 12, 977330) I am prepared to admit both.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 13, 977359) That does not, moreover, disprove the existence of the Colonial legislation restricting the freedom of the Indians in various ways.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 14, 977491) That does not disprove the existence of the terrible ill-feeling towards the Indians in the Colony.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 15, 977591) If the Indians remain in Natal, it is in spite of such treatment.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 16, 977657) It proves their marvellous forbearance, which has been so eloquently praised by Mr. Chamberlain in his despatch in connection with, to use a South African phrase, “the coolie arbitration”.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 420, 1, 17, 977846) The latest papers received from South Africa, unfortunately for the Natal Government, lend additional weight to my statement that the Indian is a cruelly persecuted being in South Africa.

European sources, to prove my assertion as against the naked
statement of Mr* Peace the Agent-General’s opinion. If Mr* Peace’s
statement is all that is to be said in reply to the pamphlet, then there
remains much to be done before Natal can become a tolerably
comfortable place for Indians. As to the Indians receiving justice in
the law-courts, I do not wish to say much. I have never stated that the
Indians do not get justice in the law-courts, nor am I prepared to
admit that they get it at all times and in all courts.
Sir, I am not given to exaggerate matters. You have asked for an
official inquiry; we have done the same. And if the Natal Government
are not afraid of unpleasant revelations, let there be such an inquiry as
soon as possible. And I think I am safe in promising that much more

Immigration 
Law Amendment 
Bill, 
which 
you 
and 
your
contemporaries condemned last year in such forcible language, has
received the Royal assent, as appears from the papers received this
week. To remind your readers, the Bill raises the period of indenture
from the original period of five years to an indefinite period and, in
default of re-indenture after the completion of the first five years,
makes it compulsory for the Indian to return to India, of course, at the
employer’s expense, and, in case of non-compliance with that term of
his contract, renders the defaulter liable to an annual poll-tax of £3,
nearly half a year’s earnings on the indenture scale. This Bill was, at
the time it was passed, unanimously pronounced to be an iniquitous
measure. Even the Natal papers were doubtful whether the Bill would
receive the Royal sanction. Yet the Bill has been promulgated and it
came into force on the 8th August.
Publicity is our best and perhaps the only weapon of defence.

I promised to leave with Mr* Sohoni some further papers in
connection with the Indian question in South Africa. I am sorry I
forgot all about it. I beg now to send them per book post and hope
they will be of some use.
We very badly need a committee of active, prominent workers
in India for our cause. The question affects not only South African
Indians but Indians in all parts of the world outside India. I have no
doubt you have read the telegram about the Australian Colonies
legislating to restrict the influx of Indian immigrants to that part of
the world. It is quite possible that legislation might receive the Royal
sanction. I submit that our great men should without delay take up
this question. Otherwise within a very short time there will be an end
to Indian enterprise outside India. In my humble opinion that
telegram might be made the subject of a question in the Imperial
Council
2 at Calcutta as well as in the House of Commons. In fact, some
enquiry as to the intention of the Indian Government should be made
immediately.
Seeing that you took very warm interest in my conversation I
thought I would venture to write the above.
I remain,
Sir,
Yours obediently,

New Para:  DEAR MR* TALEYARKHAN,
I have your important letter for which I thank you.
Your inquiry is certainly very pertinent. And you may depend
upon it that I shall answer it most frankly.
I start with the assumption that we work in partnership. Starting
on your own account at once will be out of the question.
There are cheques lying in my safe at Durban for about £300,
the retainer
1 for 1897, ending 31st July. These I propose to withdraw
from the partnership to pay liabilities incurred here and if possible to
pay the expenses that are now being incurred in connection with my
office. I say if possible, because the balance may not cover the
expenses at Durban.
If past experience is any guide for the purpose, then I think I
am safe in saying that the joint earnings for the first six months will be
at the rate of £70 per month. As against that I place the joint expenses
at £50 per month, i.e., if we share the same house. That would leave a
clear profit of £120 to be divided equally between us after six months.
This is the lowest estimate. And I should expect to earn that amount
single-handed doing the Indian work side by side. It would not
surprise me however if we earned £150 per month.
This much I can promise. You should pay your own passage to
Natal. Your expenses of admission will be paid out of the office. The
expenses of your board and lodging also will be defrayed out of the
office earnings. That is to say, if there is any loss during the six
months’ trial it shall be borne by me. On  the other hand if there are
any profits you share them.
Thus at the end of six months if you do not gain in money you
will have gained considerably in experience of a different kind from
that available in India. You will have realized the position of our
countrymen in that part of the world and you will have seen a new

a six months’ absence from Bombay would not mar your future
career there if you are disappointed in Natal. The six months’ loss in
Bombay will be requited by what I have stated above.
In any case, I cannot be too plain in saying that no one in our
position should go to South Africa with a view to pile money. You
should go there with a spirit of self-sacrifice. You should keep riches
at an arm’s length. They may then woo you. If you bestow your
glances on them, they are such a coquette that you are sure to be
slighted. That is my experience in South Africa.
As for work, apart from pecuniary considerations, I promise
that there will be more than sufficient to feed your activity—that too
legal work.
Boarding together might present a slight difficulty. If you
could manage with vegetarian food, I could place on the table most
palatable dishes cooked both in the English as well as the Indian style.
If, however, that be not possible, we shall have to engage another
cook. At any rate that cannot be an insurmountable difficulty. I trust I
have stated the position clearly. If there are any points requiring
elucidation you have only to mention them. I do hope you will not
allow pecuniary considerations to come in your way. I am sure you
will be able to do much in South Africa—more indeed than I may
have been instrumental in doing.

South Africa may, for our purposes, be divided into the two
self-governing British Colonies of Natal and the Cape of Good Hope,
the Crown Colony of Zululand, the Transvaal or the South African
Republic, the Orange Free State, the Chartered Territories and the
Portuguese Territories comprising Delagoa Bay and Beira.
South Africa is indebted to the colony of Natal for the presence
of the Indian population there. In the year 1860, when, in the words
of a member of the Natal Parliament, “the existence of the Colony
hung in the balance”, the Colony of Natal introduced indentured
Indians into the Colony. Such immigration is regulated by law, is
permissible only to few favoured States, e.g., Mauritius, Fiji, Jamaica,
Straits Settlements, Damarara and other States, and is allowed only
from Madras and Calcutta. As a result of the immigration, in the
words of another eminent Natalian, Mr* Saunders:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 426, 1, 6, 990077) As a result of the immigration, in the words of another eminent Natalian, Mr. Saunders:
New Para:  Indian Immigration brought prosperity, prices rose, people were no
longer content to grow or sell produce for a song, they could do better.
The sugar and tea industries, as well as sanitation and the
vegetable and fish supply of the Colony, are absolutely dependent on
the indentured Indians from Madras and Calcutta. The presence of the
indentured Indians, about sixteen years ago, drew the free Indians in
the shape of traders, who first went there with a view to supply the
wants of their own kith and kin; but afterwards found a very valuable
customer in the native of South Africa, called Zulu or Kaffir. These
traders are chiefly drawn from the Bombay Memon Mahomedans
and, owing to their less unfortunate position, have formed themselves
into custodians of the interests of the whole Indian population there.
Thus, adversity and identity of interests have united in compact body
the Indians from the three Presidencies, and they take pride in calling
themselves Indians rather than Madrasees or Bengalees or Gujaratees,
except when it is necessary to do so. That, however, by the way.
These Indians have now spread all over South Africa. Natal,
which is governed by a Legislative Assembly consisting of 37
members elected by the voters, a Legislative Council represents the 11
members, nominated by the governor who represents the Queen, and a
movable Ministry consisting of 5 members, contains a European
population of 50,000, a native population of 400,000 and an Indian
population of 51,000* Of the 51,000 Indians, about 16,000 are at
present serving their indenture, 30,000 are those that have completed
their indenture and are now variously engaged as domestic servants,

The self-governing Colony of the Cape of Good Hope has, I
believe, an Indians population of about 10,000, consisting of traders,
hawkers and labourers. Its total population is nearly 1,800,000, of
whom not more than 400,000 are Europeans. The rest are natives of
the country and Malaya.
The South African Republic of the Transvaal, which is governed
by two elective Chambers called the Volksraad and an Executive with
the President at its head, has an Indian population of 5,000, of whom
about 200 are traders with liquidated assets amounting to nearly
£100,000* The rest are hawkers and waiters or household servants, the
latter being men from this Presidency. Its White population is
estimated at roughly 120,000 and the Kaffir population at roughly
650,000* This Republic is subject to the Queen’s suzerainty. And
there is a Convention
1 between Great Britain and the Republic which
secures the property, trading and farming rights of all persons other
than natives of South Africa, in common with the citizens of the
Republic.
The other States have no Indian population to speak of, because
of the grievances and disabilities, except the Portuguese territories
which contain a very large Indian population and which do not give
any trouble to the Indians.
The grievances of the Indians in South Africa are twofold, i.e.,
those that are due to popular ill-feeling against the Indians and,
secondly, the legal disabilities placed upon them. To deal with the
first, the Indian is the most hated being in South Africa. Every Indian
without distinction is contemptuously called a“coolie”. He is also
called“Sammy”,“ Ramasammy”, anything but“Indian”. Indian
schoolmasters are called“coolie schoolmasters”. Indian storekeepers

are “coolie owners”. And I can assure you, gentlemen, that there is as
much difference between the partners of that firm and a “coolie” as
there is between anyone in this hall and a coolie. The railway and tram
officials, in spite of the contradiction that has appeared in official
quarters which I am going to deal with presently, I repeat, treat us as
beasts. We cannot safely walk on the foot-paths. A Madrasi gentleman,
spotlessly dressed, always avoids the foot-paths of prominent streets in
Durban for fear he should be insulted or pushed off.
We are the“Asian dirt”to be“heartily cursed”, we are “chock-
full of vice”and we “live upon rice”, we are “stinking coolie” living
on“the smell of an oiled rag”, we are “ the black vermin”, we are
described in the Statute books as“ semi-barbarous Asiatics, or persons
belonging to the uncivilized races of Asia”. We “breed like rabbits”
and a gentleman at a meeting lately held in Durban said he was sorry
we could not be shot like them. There are coaches running between
certain places in the Transvaal. We may not sit inside them. It is a sore
trial, apart from the indignity it involves and contemplates, to have to
sit outside them, either in deadly winter morning, for the winter is
severe in the Transvaal, or under a burning sun, though we are
Indians. The hotels refuse us admission. Indeed, there are cases in
which respectable Indians have found it difficult even to procure
refreshments at European places. It was only a short time ago, that a
gang of Europeans set fire to an Indian store in a village called
Dundee in Natal, doing some damage, and another gang threw
burning crackers into the Indian stores in a business street in Durban.
This feeling of intense hatred has been reproduced into
legislation in the various States of South Africa restricting the freedom
of Indians in many ways. To begin with, Natal, which is the most
important from an Indian point of view, has, of late, shown the greatest
activity in passing Indian legislation. Till 1894, the Indians had been
enjoying the franchise equally with the Europeans under the general
franchise law of the Colony, which entitles any adult male, being a
British subject, to be placed on the Voters’ List, who possesses
immovable property  worth £50 or pays an annual rent of £10* There
is a separate franchise qualification for the Zulu. In 1894, the Natal
Legislature passed a Bill disfranchising Asiatics by name. We resisted
it in the local Parliament, but without any avail. We them
memorialized the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and, as a result,

There is a separate franchise qualification for the Zulu.

European from voting.
Thus, the Natal legislature is playing a game of “Toss up” at
the Indians’ expense. We are a fit subject for vivisection under the
Natal Pasteur’s deadly scalpel and knife, with this difference between
the Paris Pasteur and the Natal Pasteur that, while the former indulged
in vivisection with the object of benefiting humanity, the latter has
been indulging in it for the sake of amusement out of sheer
wantonness. The object of this measure is not political. It is purely and

native land than in Natal”; in the words of another eminent Natalian:
“To keep him for ever a hewer of wood and drawer of water”. The
very fact that at present there are only 251 Indian, as against nearly
10,000 European, voters shows that there is no fear of the Indian vote

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 430, 1, 2, 999567) question in Natal, thus puts it, in its issue of the 27th day of June of this year:
New Para:  The question now put before Mr* Chamberlain is not an academic one.
It is not a question of argument but of race feeling. We cannot afford a war of
races among our own subjects. It would be as wrong for the Government of
India to suddenly arrest the development of Natal by shutting all supply of
immigrants, as it would be for Natal to deny the right of citizenship to British
Indian subjects who, by years of thrift and good work in the Colony, have
raised themselves to the actual status of citizens.
If there is any real danger of the Asiatic vote swamping the
European, we should have no objection to an educational test being
imposed or the property qualifications being raised. What we object to
is class legislation and the degradation which it necessarily involves.
We are fighting for no new privilege in opposing the Bill. We are
resisting the deprivation of the one we have been enjoying.
In strict accordance with the policy of degrading the Indian to
the level of a raw Kaffir and, in the words of the Attorney-General of
Natal, “that of preventing him from forming part of the future South
African nation that is going to be built”, the Natal Government, last
year, introduced their Bill to amend the Indian Immigration Act which
I regret to inform you, has received the Royal sanction in spite of our
hopes to the contrary. This news was received after the Bombay
meeting
1, and it will, therefore, be necessary for me to deal with this
question at some length, also because this question more immediately
affects this Presidency and can be best studied here.
Up to the 18th day of August, 1894, the indentured immigrants
went under a contract of service for five years in consideration for a
free passage to Natal, free board and lodging for themselves and  their
families, and wages at the rate of ten shillings per month for the first
year, to be increased by one shilling every following year. They were
also  entitled to a free passage back to India if they remained in the
Colony another five years as free labourers. This is now changed and,
in future, the immigrants will have either to remain in the Colony for
ever under indenture, their wages increasing to 20 shillings at the end
of the 9th year of indentured service, or to return to India or to pay an
annual poll-tax of £ 3 sterling, equivalent to nearly half a years’
earnings on the indentured scale. A Commission consisting of two

induce the Indian Government to agree to the above alterations with
the exception of the imposition of the poll-tax. The present Viceroy,
while expressing his reluctance, agreed to alteration subject to the
sanction of the Home Government, refusing to allow the Natal
Government to make the breach of the clause about compulsory
return a criminal offence. The Natal Government have got over the
difficulty by the poll-tax clause.
The Attorney-General, in discussing that clause, said that, while
an Indian could not be sent to gaol for refusing to return to India or
to pay the tax, so long as there was anything worth having in his hut it
will be liable to seizure. We strongly opposed that Bill in the local
Parliament and failing there, sent a memorial to Mr* Chamberlain,
praying either that the Bill should be disallowed or emigration to
Natal should be suspended.

of passing a law to force Indians back to India at the expiration of their term
of service unless they renew their indentures, I wish to express my strong

sought to escape when they were young. Shylock-like, taking the pound of

men off at the end of their service, this the Colony cannot do. And I urge on it

The Attorney-General of Natal, who introduced the Bill under

New Para:  With reference to time-expired Indians, I do not think that it ought to
be compulsory on any man to go to any part of the world save for a crime for
which he is transported. I hear a great deal of this question; I have been asked
again and again to take a different view, but I have not been able to do it. A
man is brought here, in theory with his own consent, in practice very often
without  his consent, he gives the best five years of his life, he forms new
ties, forgets the old ones, perhaps establishes a home here, and he cannot,
according to my view of right and wrong, be sent back. Better by far to stop
the further introduction of Indians altogether than to take what work you can
out of them and order them away. The Colony, or part of the Colony, seems to
want Indians but also wishes to avoid the consequences of Indian
immigration. The Indian people do no harm as far as I know: in certain
respects they do a great deal of good. I have never heard a reason to justify the
extradition of a man who has behaved well for five years.
And Mr* Binns, who came to India as one of the Natal
Commissioners to induce the Indian Government to agree to the
above-mentioned alterations, gave the following evidence before the
Commission ten years ago:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 432, 1, 2, 1004756) With reference to time-expired Indians, I do not think that it ought to be compulsory on any man to go to any part of the world save for a crime for which he is transported.

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 432, 1, 9, 1005801) And Mr. Binns, who came to India as one of the Natal Commissioners to induce the Indian Government to agree to the above-mentioned alterations, gave the following evidence before the Commission ten years ago:
New Para:  I think the idea which has been mooted, that all Indians should be
compelled to return to India at the end of their term of indenture, is most unfair
to the Indian population and would never be sanctioned by the Indian
Government. In my opinion, the free Indian population is a most useful
section of the community.
But, then, great men may change their views as often and as
quickly as they may change their clothes, with impunity and even to
advantage. In them, they say, such changes are a result of sincere
conviction. It is a thousand pities, however, that, unfortunately for the
poor indentured Indian, his fear or, rather, the expectation, that the
Indian Government will never sanction the change was not realized.
The London Star thus gave vent to its feelings on reading the
Bill:

New Para:  These particulars are enough to throw light upon the hateful
persecution to which British Indian subjects are being subjected. The new
Indian Immigration Law Amendment Bill, which virtually proposes to reduce
Indians to a state of slavery, is another example. The thing is a monstrous
wrong, an insult to British subjects, a disgrace to its authors, and a slight
upon ourselves. Every Englishman is concerned to see that the commercial
greed of the South African trader is not permitted to wreak such bitter injustice

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 432, 3, 16, 1006801) These particulars are enough to throw light upon the hateful persecution to which British Indian subjects are being subjected.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 432, 3, 17, 1006928) The new Indian Immigration Law Amendment Bill, which virtually proposes to reduce Indians to a state of slavery, is another example.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 432, 3, 18, 1007061) The thing is a monstrous wrong, an insult to British subjects, a disgrace to its authors, and a slight upon ourselves.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 432, 3, 19, 1007180) Every Englishman is concerned to see that the commercial greed of the South African trader is not permitted to wreak such bitter injustice upon men who, alike by proclamation and by statute, are placed upon an equality with ourselves before the Law.

New Para:   
The Government of India has one simple remedy. It can suspend
indentured immigration to South Africa as it has suspended such immigration
to foreign possessions until it obtains the necessary guarantees for the
present well-being and the future status of the immigrants. . . . It is eminently
a case for sensible and conciliatory action on both sides. . . . But the Indian
Government may be forced to adopt measures in connection with the wider
claim now being urged by every  section of the Indian community and which
has been explicitly acknowledged by Her Majesty’s Government at home,
namely, the claim of the Indian races to trade and to labour with the full status
of British subjects throughout the British Empire and in allied States.
The letters from Natal, informing me of the Royal sanction to
this Bill, ask me to request the Indian public to help us to get
emigration suspended. I am well aware that the idea of suspending
emigration requires careful consideration. I humbly think that there is
no other conclusion possible in the interests of the Indians at large.
Emigration is supposed to relieve the congested districts and to benefit
those who emigrate. If the Indian, instead of paying the poll-tax,
return to India, the congestion cannot be affected at all. And the
returned Indians will rather be a source of difficulty than anything
else, as they must necessarily find it difficult to get work and cannot
be expected to bring sufficient to live upon the interest of their
capital. It certainly will not benefit the emigrants as they will never, if
the Government can possibly help it, be allowed to rise higher than the
status of labourers. The fact is that they are being helped on to
degradation. Under such circumstances, I humbly ask you to support
our prayer to suspend emigration to Natal unless the new law can be
altered or repealed.
You will naturally be anxious to know the treatment of the
Indians while under indenture. Of course, that life cannot be bright
under any circumstances; but I do not think their lot is worse than the
lot of the Indians similarly placed in other parts of the world. At the
same time, they, too, certainly come in for a share of the tremendous
colour prejudice. I can only briefly allude to the matter here and refer
the curious to the Green Pamphlet, wherein it has been more fully

asked to do so. It is meant to detect desertion by the indentured
Indians. The working of this system is a source of much irritation to
poor free Indians and often puts respectable Indians  in a very
unpleasant position. This law really would not give any trouble but for
the unreasonable prejudice. A sympathetic Protector of Immigrants,
preferably an Indian gentleman of high standing and knowing the
Tamil, Telugu and Hindustani languages, would certainly mitigate the
usual hardships of the indentured life. An Indian immigrant who loses
his free pass is, as a rule, called upon to pay £3 sterling for a duplicate
copy. This is nothing but a system of blackmail.
The 9 o’clock rule in Natal, which makes it necessary for every
Indian to carry a pass, if  he wants to be out after 9 p.m., at the pain of
being locked up in a dungeon, causes much heart-burning, especially
among the gentlemen from this Presidency. You will be pleased to
hear that children of many indentured Indians receive a pretty good
education and they wear, as a rule, the European dress. They are a
most sensitive class and yet, unfortunately, most liable to arrest under
the 9 o’clock rule. The European dress for an Indian is no
recommendation in Natal. It is rather the reverse, for the flowing robe
of a Memon free the wearer from  such molestation. A happy
incident, described in the Green Pamphlet, led the police in Durban,
some years ago, to free Indians thus dressed from liability to arrest
after 9 p.m. A Tamil schoolmistress, a Tamil schoolmaster and a
Tamil Sunday school-teacher were, only a few months ago, arrested
and locked up under this law. They all got justice in the law-courts,
but that was a poor consolation. The result, however, was that the
Corporations in Natal are clamouring for an alteration in the law so
that it might be impossible for such Indians to get off scot-free in the
law-courts.
There is a bye-law in Durban which requires registration of
coloured servants. This rule may be, and perhaps is, necessary for the
Kaffirs who would not work, but absolutely useless with regard to the
Indians. But the policy is to class the Indian with the Kaffir whenever
possible.

New Para:  But, gentlemen, you have been told lately by the Natal Agent-
General that the Indians are nowhere better treated than in Natal; that
the fact that a majority of the indentured labourers do not avail
themselves of the return passage is the best answer to my pamphlet,
and that the railway and tram-car officials do not treat the Indians as
beasts nor do the law-courts deny them justice.
With the greatest deference to the Agent-General, all I can say
as to the first statement is that he must have very queer notions of
good treatment, if to be locked up for being out after 9 p.m. without a
pass, to be denied the most elementary right of citizenship in a free
country, to be denied a higher status than that of bondman and, at
best, a free labourer, and to be subjected to other restrictions referred
to above, are instances of good treatment. And if such treatment is the
best the Indians receive throughout the world,  then the lot of the
Indians in other parts of the world and here must be very miserable
indeed, according to the commonsense view. The thing is that Mr*
Walter Peace, the Agent-General, is made to look through the official
spectacles and to him everything official is bound to appear rosy. The
legal disabilities are condemnatory of the action of the Natal
Government, and how can the Agent-General be expected to condemn
himself? If he, or the Government which he represents, only admitted
that the legal disabilities mentioned above were against the
fundamental principles of the British Constitution, I should not stand
before you this evening. I respectfully submit that statements of
opinions made by the Agent-General cannot be allowed to have
greater weight than those of an accused person about his own guilt.
The fact that the indentured Indians, as a rule, do not avail
themselves of the return passage we do not dispute, but we certainly
dispute that it is the best answer to our complaints. How can that fact
disprove the existence of the legal disabilities? It may prove that the
Indians, who do not take advantage of the return passage, either do
not mind the disabilities, or remain in the Colony in spite of such
disabilities. If the former be the case, it is the duty of those who know
better to make the Indians realize their situation and to enable them to
see that submission to them means degradation. If the latter be the

of the Indian Nation which was acknowledged by Mr* Chamberlain in
his Despatch in connection with the Transvaal arbitration. Because
they bear them is no reason why the disabilities should not be
removed or why they should be interpreted into meaning the best
treatment possible.
Moreover, who are these people who, instead of returning to
India, settle in the Colony? They are the Indians drawn from the
poorest classes and from the most thickly populated districts, possibly
living in a state of semi-starvation in India. They migrated to Natal
with their families, if any, with the intention of settling there, if
possible. Is it any wonder, if these people, after the expiry of their
indenture, instead of returning “to face semistarvation”, as Mr*
Saunders has put it, settle in a country where the climate is
magnificent and where they may earn a decent living? A starving man,
generally, would stand any amount of rough treatment to get a crumb
of bread.
Do not the Uitlanders make out a terribly long list of grievances
in the Transvaal? And yet, do they not flock to the Transvaal in
thousands in spite of the ill-treatment they receive there, because they
can earn their bread in the Transvaal more easily than in the old
country?
This, too, should be borne in mind that, in making his statement,
Mr* Peace has not taken into account the free Indian trader who goes
to the Colony on his own account and who feels most the indignities
and disabilities. If it does not do to tell the Uitlander that he may not
go to the Transvaal if he cannot bear the ill-treatment, much less will it
do to say so to the enterprising Indian. We belong to the Imperial
family and are children, adopted it may be, of the same august
mother, having the same rights and privileges guaranteed to us as to
the European children. It was in that belief that we went to the Colony
of Natal, and we trust that our belief was well founded.
The Agent-General has contradicted the statement made in the
pamphlet that the railway and tram-car official treat the Indians as
beasts. Even if the statements I have made were incorrect, that would

tram-car officials. That statement was made now nearly two years ago
in quarters where it would have been contradicted at once. I had the
honour to address an ‘Open Letter’

Parliament in Natal. It was widely circulated in the Colony and noticed
by almost every leading newspaper in South Africa. No one
contradicted it then. It was even admitted by some newspapers. Under
such circumstances, I ventured to quote it in my pamphlet published
here. I am not given to exaggerate matters, and it is very unpleasant to
me to have to cite testimony in my own favour, but since an attempt
has been made to discredit my statements and, thereby, the cause I am

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 437, 1, 3, 1017829) That statement was made now nearly two years ago in quarters where it would have been contradicted at once.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 437, 1, 4, 1017937) I had the honour to address an ‘Open Letter’ 1 to the members of the local Parliament in Natal.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 437, 1, 5, 1018033) It was widely circulated in the Colony and noticed by almost every leading newspaper in South Africa.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 437, 1, 6, 1018135) No one contradicted it then.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 437, 1, 7, 1018164) It was even admitted by some newspapers.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 437, 1, 8, 1018205) Under such circumstances, I ventured to quote it in my pamphlet published here.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 437, 1, 9, 1018285) I am not given to exaggerate matters, and it is very unpleasant to me to have to cite testimony in my own favour, but since an attempt has been made to discredit my statements and, thereby, the cause I am advocating, I feel it to be my duty, for the sake of the cause, to tell you what the papers in South Africa thought about the ‘Open Letter’, in which the statement was made.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 437, 1, 10, 1018664) The Star, the leading newspaper in Johannesburg, says:
New Para:  Mr* Gandhi writes forcibly, moderately and well. He has himself
suffered some slight measure of injustice since he came into the Colony, but
that fact does not seem to have coloured his sentiment, and it must be
confessed that  to the tone of the open letter no objection can reasonably be
taken. Mr* Gandhi discusses the questions he has raised with conspicuous
moderation.
The Natal Mercury, the Government organ in Natal, says:

anyone could expect him to be and probably a little more so than might have
been expected, considering that he did not receive very just treatment at the

Had I made unfounded statements, the newspapers would not
have given such a certificate to the ‘Open Letter’.
An Indian, about two years ago, took out a second-class ticket
on the Natal railway, In a single night journey he was thrice disturbed
and was twice made to change compartments to please European
passengers. The case came before the Court and the Indian got £10
damages. The following is the plaintiff’s evidence in the case:

New Para:  place someone here.” Witness said: “Why should I come out from here when I
have paid my fare?” ... The white man then left and brought an Indian who,
witness believed, was in the employ of the railway. The Indian was told to tell
plaintiff to get out of the carriage. Thereupon the Indian said: “The white man
orders you to come out and you must come out.” The Indian then left. Witness
said to the white man: “What do you want to shift me about for? I have paid
my fare and have a right to remain here.” The white man became angry at this
and said: “Well, if you don’t come out, I will knock hell out of you.” The
white man got into the carriage and laid hold of witness by the arm and tried to
pull him out. Plaintiff said: “Let me alone and I will come out.” The witness
left the carriage and the white man pointed out another second-class
compartment and told him to go there. Plaintiff did as he was directed. The
compartment he was shown into was empty. He believed some people who
were playing a band were put into the carriage from which he was expelled.
This white man was the District Superintendent of Railways at Newcastle. To
proceed, witness travelled undisturbed to Maritzburg. He fell asleep, and when
he awoke at Maritzburg he found a white man, a white woman and a child in
the compartment with him. A white man came up to the carriage and said: “Is
that your boy?” speaking to the white man in the compartment. Witness’s
fellow-traveller replied: “Yes”, pointing to his little boy. The other white
man then said: “No, I don’t mean him. I mean the damned coolie in the
corner.” This gentleman with the choice language was a railway official,
being a shunter. The white man in the compartment replied: “Oh, never mind
him, leave him alone.” Then the white man outside (the official) said : “I am
not going to allow a coolie to be in the same compartment with white
people.” This man addressed plaintiff, saying: “Sammy, come out.” Plaintiff
said: “Why, I was removed at Newcastle to this compartment.” The white man
said: “Well, you must come out” and was about to enter the carriage. Witness,
thinking he would be handled as at Newcastle, said he would go out and left the
compartment. The white man pointed out another second-class compartment
which witness entered. This was empty for a time but, before leaving, a white
man entered. Another white man (the official) afterwards came up and said: “If
you don’t like to travel with that stinking coolie, I will find you another
carriage” (The Natal Advertiser, 22nd November, 1893, Wednesday).
You will have noticed that the official at Maritzburg maltreated
the Indian passenger although his white fellow-passenger did not
mind him. If this is not bestial treatment, I should very much like to
know what it is, and such occurrences take place often enough to be
irritating.
It was found during the case that one of the witnesses for the
defendant was coached. In answer to a question from the Bench
whether the Indian passengers were treated with consideration, the

New Para:  It was indisputable from the evidence that the Arab had been badly
treated and seeing that second-class tickets are issued to Indians of this
description, the plaintiff ought not to have been subjected to unnecessary
annoyance and indignity . . . . Some definite measures should be taken to
minimize the danger of trouble arising between European and coloured
passengers, without rendering the carrying out of such measures annoying to
any person, whether black or white.

New Para:  There is, throughout South Africa, a tendency to treat all Indians as
coolies pure and simple, no matter whether they be educated and cleanly in
their habits or not. On our railways we have noticed, on more than one
occasion, that coloured passengers are not by any means treated with civility,
and although it would be unreasonable to expect that the white employees of
the N.G.R* should treat them with the same deference as is accorded to
European passengers, still we think it would not be in any way derogatory to
their dignity if the officials were a little more suaviter in modo when dealing
with coloured travellers. (24-11-1893)
The Cape  Times, a leading newspaper in South Africa, says:

contempt for the very class of people she can least do without. Imagination

withdrawal of the Indian population from that Colony. And yet the Indians is

I think I have adduced sufficient outside testimony to
substantiate my statement that the railway officials treat the Indians as
beasts. On the tram-cars, the Indians are often not allowed to sit inside
but are sent ‘upstairs’, as the phrase goes. They are often made to
remove from one seat to another or prevented from occupying front
benches. I know an Indian officer, a Tamil gentleman, dressed in the
latest European style who was made to stand on the tram-car board,
although there was accommodation available for him.
As to the statement that the Indians get justice in the lawcourts, I
beg to say that I have never said they do not, nor am I prepared to
admit that they get it at all times and in all courts.
Quoting statistics to prove the prosperity of the Indian
community is quite unnecessary. It is not denied that the Indians who
go to Natal do earn a living and that in spite of the persecution.
In the Transvaal we cannot own landed property, we may not

the British Agent “as places to deposit the refuse of the town, without
any water except the polluted soakage in the gully between the

paths in Johannesburg and Pretoria, we may not be out after 9 p.m.
We may not travel without passes. The law prevents us from travelling
first or second class on the railways. We are required to pay a special

though we are treated as mere “chattels” and have no privileges

The Cape Parliament has passed a Bill granting the East London
Municipality in that Colony the power to frame bye-laws prohibiting
Indians from walking on the foot-paths and making them live in
locations. It has issued instructions to the authorities of East
Griqualand not to issue any trading licences to the Indians. The Cape
Government are in communication with the Home Government with a
view to induce them to sanction legislation restricting the influx of the
Asiatics.
The people in the Chartered Territories are endeavouring to
close the country against the Asiatic trader.
In Zululand, Crown Colony, we cannot own or acquire landed
property in the townships of Eshowe and Nondweni. This question is
now before Mr* Chamberlain for consideration. As in the Transvaal,
there also it is criminal for an Indian to buy native gold.
Thus, we are hemmed in on all sides by restrictions. And, if
nothing further were to be done here and in England on our behalf, it
is merely a question of time when the respectable Indian in South
Africa will be absolutely extinct.
Nor is this merely a local question. It is, as the London Times
puts it, “that of the status of the British Indian outside India”. “If”,
says the Thunderer, “they fail to secure that position (that is of equal
status) in South Africa, it will be difficult for them to attain it
elsewhere.” I have no doubt you have read in the papers that
Australian Colonies have passed legislation to prevent Indians from
settling in that part of the world. It will be interesting to know how the
Home Government deal with that question.
The real cause of all this prejudice may be expressed in the
words of the leading organ in South Africa, namely, the Cape Times,
when it was under the editorship of the prince of South African
journalists, Mr* St* Leger:

them above that degrading level.

New Para:  It will, therefore, probably yet be found that the removal of the
drawbacks at present incidental to the immigration of Indians into British
Colonies is not to be effected so much by the adoption of the obsolete policy
of exclusion as by an enlightened and progressive application of
ameliorating laws to those Indians who settle in them. One of the chief
objection to Indians is that they do not live in accordance with European
rules. The remedy for this is to gradually raise their mode of life by
compelling them to live in better dwellings and by creating among them new
wants. It will probably be found easier, because more in accord with the great
onward movements of mankind, to demand of such settlers that they shall rise
to their new conditions than to endeavour to maintain the status quo ante by
their entire exclusion.
We believe, also, that much of the ill feeling is due to the want
of proper knowledge in South Africa about the Indians in India. We

British subjects throughout the whole British Empire and in allied States.
This is the position which you and our Indian friends in South Africa should
firmly take up. In such a question compromise is impossible. For any
compromise would relinquish the fundamental right of the Indian races to the
complete status of British subjects—a right which they have earned by their
loyalty in peace and by their services in war, a right which was solemnly
guaranteed to them by the Queen’s Proclamation in 1858 and which has now
been explicitly recognized by Her Majesty’s Government.

principles of the Indian Code and seems to me an infringement of the
privileges guaranteed to British subjects in India. Again, it is perfectly
evident that in the Boer Republic and possibly in Natal, it is the direct
obvious intention of the Government to “hunt” natives of India and to compel
them to carry on their business under degrading conditions. The excuses
which are put forward to defend the infringements of the liberties of British

New Para:  What with a strong and intelligent public opinion here and a well
meaning Government, the difficulties we have to contend with are not at all
commensurate with those that retard the well-being of our countrymen in that
country. It is, therefore, quite time that all public bodies should at once turn
their attention to this important subject to create an intelligent public
opinion with a view to organize an agitation for the removal of the
grievances under which our brethren are labouring. Indeed, these grievances
have become and are day by day becoming so unbearable and offensive that
the requisite agitation cannot be taken up one day too soon.
I may state our position a little more clearly. We are aware that
the insults and indignities that we are subjected to at the hands of the
populace cannot be directly removed by the intervention of the Home
Government. We do not appeal to it for any such intervention. We
bring them to the notice of the public so that the fair-minded of all
communities and the Press may, by expressing their disapproval,
materially reduce their rigour and, possibly, eradicate them ultimately.
But we certainly do appeal, and we hope not vainly, to the Home
Government for protection against reproduction of such ill feeling in
legislation. We certainly beseech the Home Government to disallow all
the Acts of the Legislative bodies of the Colonies restricting our
freedom in any shape or form. And this brings me to the last question,
namely, how far can the Home Government interfere with such action
on the part of the Colonies and the allied States. As for Zululand,
there can be no question, since it is a Crown Colony directly governed
from Downing Street through a Governor. It is not a self-governing or
a responsibly-governed Colony, as the Colonies of Natal and the Cape
of Good Hope are. With regard to the last two, their Constitution Act
provides that Her Majesty may disallow any act of the local Parliament
within two years, even after it has become law having received the
Governor’s assent. That is one safeguard against oppressive measures
by the Colonies. The Royal instructions to the Government, as also the
Constitution Act, enumerate certain Bills which cannot be assented to

such are Bills which have, for their object, class legislation, such as the
Franchise Bill or Immigration Bill. Her Majesty’s intervention is, thus,
direct and precise. While it is true that the Home Government is slow
to interfere with the Acts of the Colonial legislatures, there are
instances where it has not hesitated to put its foot down on occasions
less urgent than the present one. As you are aware, the repeal of the
first Franchise Bills was due to such wholesome intervention. What is
more, the Colonists are ever afraid of it. And as a result of the
sympathy expressed in England and the sympathetic answer given by
Mr* Chamberlain to the Deputation that waited on him some months
ago, most of the papers in South Africa, at any rate in Natal, have
veered round considerably. As to the Transvaal, there is the
Convention. As to the Orange Free State, I can only say that it is an
unfriendly act on the part of a friendly State to shut her doors against
any portion of Her Majesty’s subjects. And as such, I humbly think it
can be effectively checked.

Times articles, bearing on the question of intervention as well as the

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 1, 6, 1039722) As you are aware, the repeal of the first Franchise Bills was due to such wholesome intervention.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 1, 7, 1039820) What is more, the Colonists are ever afraid of it.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 1, 8, 1039871) And as a result of the sympathy expressed in England and the sympathetic answer given by Mr. Chamberlain to the Deputation that waited on him some months ago, most of the papers in South Africa, at any rate in Natal, have veered round considerably.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 1, 9, 1040120) As to the Transvaal, there is the Convention.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 1, 10, 1040166) As to the Orange Free State, I can only say that it is an unfriendly act on the part of a friendly State to shut her doors against any portion of Her Majesty’s subjects.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 1, 11, 1040336) And as such, I humbly think it can be effectively checked.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 1, 12, 1040395) It may not be amiss to quote a few passages from the London Times articles, bearing on the question of intervention as well as the whole question generally:
New Para:  The whole question resolves itself into this. Are Her Majesty’s Indian
subjects to be treated as a degraded and an outcaste race by a friendly
Government or are they to have the same rights and status as other British
subjects enjoy? Are leading Mohammedan merchants, who might sit in the
Legislative Council at Bombay, to be liable to indignities and outrages in the
South African Republic? We are continually telling our Indian subjects that
the economic future of their country depends on their ability to spread
themselves out and to develop their foreign trade. What answer can our Indian
Government give them if it fails to secure to them the same protection abroad
which is secured to the subjects of every other dependency of the Crown?

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 2, 13, 1040552) The whole question resolves itself into this.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 2, 14, 1040598) Are Her Majesty’s Indian subjects to be treated as a degraded and an outcaste race by a friendly Government or are they to have the same rights and status as other British subjects enjoy?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 2, 15, 1040786) Are leading Mohammedan merchants, who might sit in the Legislative Council at Bombay, to be liable to indignities and outrages in the South African Republic?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 2, 16, 1040944) We are continually telling our Indian subjects that the economic future of their country depends on their ability to spread themselves out and to develop their foreign trade.

New Para:  It is a mockery to urge our Indian fellow-subjects to embark on external
commerce if the moment they leave India they lose their rights as British
subjects and can be treated by foreign governments as a degraded and an
outcaste race.
In another article it says:

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 445, 3, 19, 1041531) In another article it says:
New Para:  The matter is eminently one for good offices and for influence for that
“friendly negotiation” which Mr* Chamberlain promises, though he warns the
deputation that it may be tedious and will certainly not be easy. As to the
Cape Colony and Natal, the question is to a certain extent simplified since, of
course, the Colonial office can speak to them with greater authority.

New Para:  The incident is one of those which suggest wider questions than any
that directly offer themselves for official replies. We are at the centre of a
world-wide Empire at a period when locomotion is easy and is everyday
becoming easier, both in time and cost. Some portions of the Empire are
crowded, others are comparatively empty, and the flow from the congested to
the under-peopled districts is continuous. What is to happen when subjects
differing in colour, religion and habits from ourselves or from the natives of a
particular spot emigrate to that spot for their living ? How are race prejudices
and antipathies, the jealousies of trade, the fear of competition to be
controlled? The answer, of course, must be by intelligent policy at the
Colonial Office.

New Para:  Small as are the requirements of the Indians, the steady growth of the
population of India is such that certain outward movement is inevitable, and it
is a movement that will increase. It is very desirable that our white fellow-
subjects in Africa should understand that there will, in all probability, be this
current flowing from India, that it is perfectly within the rights of the British
Indian to seek his subsistence at the Cape, and that he ought, in the common
interest of the Empire, to be well treated when he comes there. It is indeed to
be feared that the ordinary Colonist, wherever settled, thinks much more of
his immediate interests than of those of the great empire which protects him,
and he has some difficulty in recognizing a fellow-subject in the Hindu or the
Parsee. The duty of the Colonial office is to enlighten him and to see that fair
treatment is extended to British subjects of whatever colour.

New Para:  In India, the British, the Hindu and the Mussalman communities find
themselves face to face with the question as to whether at the outset of the new
industrial movements which have been so long and anxiously awaited, Indian
traders and workers are or are not to have the same status before the law as all
other British subjects enjoy. May they or may they not go freely from one
British possession to another and claim the rights of British subjects in allied
states? Or are they to be treated as outcaste races subjected to a system of
permits and passes when travelling on their ordinary business avocations and
relegated, as the Transvaal Government would relegate them, to a ghetto at the
permanent centres of their trade? These are questions which apply to all
Indians who seek to better their fortunes outside the limits of the Indian
Empire. Mr* Chamberlain’s words and the determined attitude taken up by
every section of the Indian Press show that to such questions there can be but
one answer.
 
I shall take the liberty to give one more quotation from the
same journal:

subjects in regard to redress from foreign States. It would, indeed, have been
impossible to deny that principle. Our Indian subjects have been fighting the
battles of Great Britain over half the old world with a loyalty and courage
which have won the admiration of all British men. The fighting reserve which
Great Britain has in the Indian races adds greatly to her political influence and
prestige, and it would be violation of the British sense of justice to use the
blood and the valour of these races in war and yet to deny them the protection
of the British name in the enterprise of peace. The Indian workers and traders
are slowly spreading across the earth from Central Asia to the Australian
Colonies and from the Straits Settlements to the Canary Islands. Wherever the
Indian goes he is the same useful, well-doing man, law-abiding under whatever
form of Government he may find himself, frugal in his wants and industrious
in his habits. But these very virtues make him a formidable competitor in the
labour markets to which he resorts. Although numbering in the aggregate
some hundreds of thousands, the immigrant Indian labourers and small dealers
have only recently appeared in the foreign countries or British Colonies in
numbers sufficient to arouse jealousy and to expose them to political
injustice. But the facts which we brought to notice in June, and which we
urged on Mr* Chamberlain by a deputation of Indians last week, show that the
necessity has now arisen for protecting the Indian labourer from such jealousy
and for securing to him the same rights as other British subjects enjoy.
Gentlemen, Bombay has spoken in no uncertain terms. We are
yet young and inexperienced, we have a right to appeal to you, our
elder and freer brethren, for protection. Being under the yoke of
oppression, we can merely cry out in anguish. You have heard our
cry. The blame will now lie on your shoulders if the yoke is not
removed from our necks.

It would be ungrateful on my part if I did not thank the Madras
public for rallying round the cause of the British Indians in South
Africa as they did so admirably last evening. Indeed, all seemed to
have vied with one another in making the meeting a huge success
which it evidently was. I beg to thank you for your cordial support to
the movement. It, perhaps, shows the absolute righteousness of the
cause and the reality of our grievances. My special thanks are due to
the courteous Secretaries of the Madras Mahajana Sabha, who worked
with unremitting zeal in organizing the meeting and made the cause
their own. Ionly hope that the sympathy and support, thus far
extended, will be continued and we shall not be long in securing
justice. I beg to assure you and the public that the news of the last
night’s meeting, when it reaches South Africa, will fill the hearts of the
Indians with gladness and joy and thankfulness. Such meetings will
form a silver lining to the cloud of distress that is hanging over our
heads. As it was very late last evening I was unable to give expression
to the above sentiments. Hence this letter.
The scramble for the copies of the pamphlet was a scene I will
not easily forget. I am issuing a second edition of the pamphlet, and
as soon as the copies are ready, they can be had from the obliging
Secretaries of the Sabha.

New Para:  The rush for copies of this pamphlet at the Madras meeting
1 in
Pachaiyappa’s Hall has necessitated the issue of the second edition. It
was a scene never to be forgotten.
The demand proved two things—the importance of the question
of the grievances of the British Indians in South Africa, and the
interest shown by the Indian public in the welfare of their countrymen
beyond the waters.
It is to be hoped that the second edition will be disposed of as
soon as the first, showing the continuance of the interest. Publicity is
perhaps the chief remedy for the grievances and the pamphlet is one
of the means to that end.
The appendix is an addition to the 1st edition and is a part of
the address read before the Madras meeting, being a reply to the Natal
Agent-General’s statement to Reuter.
The Natal Immigration Law Amendment Act referred to in the
pamphlet has, unfortunately for the poor Indians in South Africa,
received the Royal assent. It is respectfully submitted that the question
requires the closest study by our public men and there should be no
rest till the Act is repealed or State-aided emigration to Natal
suspended. The Madras meeting has passed a resolution requesting
suspension of such emigration if the repeal of the Act cannot be
brought about.

Your last letter was redirected to me here. I wrote
1 to you from
Madras informing you of my address in Calcutta and wrote
2 to you
after my arrival here. I hope you received both the letters.
It is quite true that you will be making a pecuniary sacrifice in
going to Natal. But I am sure the cause is worth the sacrifice.
I shall endeavour to catch the Courland which is expected to
leave before the 20th instant. I wish you could be ready by that time.
Will you consider the new Franchise Law of Natal and get the
opinion of the eminent lawyers in Bombay if they would do so gratis?
You will find the text of the Bill in the Franchise memorial and one
legal opinion on it in the pamphlet. Any opinion obtained here will be
very useful to us in Natal.
I believe the meeting here will come off Friday week. The

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 450, 3, 4, 1050287) DEAR MR. TALEYARKHAN, Your last letter was redirected to me here.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 450, 3, 5, 1050353) I wrote 1 to you from Madras informing you of my address in Calcutta and wrote 2 to you after my arrival here.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 450, 3, 6, 1050464) I hope you received both the letters.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 450, 3, 7, 1050502) It is quite true that you will be making a pecuniary sacrifice in going to Natal.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 450, 3, 8, 1050584) But I am sure the cause is worth the sacrifice.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 450, 3, 9, 1050632) I shall endeavour to catch the Courland which is expected to leave before the 20th instant.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 450, 3, 10, 1050724) I wish you could be ready by that time.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 450, 3, 11, 1050764) Will you consider the new Franchise Law of Natal and get the opinion of the eminent lawyers in Bombay if they would do so gratis?
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 450, 3, 12, 1050894) You will find the text of the Bill in the Franchise memorial and one legal opinion on it in the pamphlet.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 450, 3, 13, 1051000) Any opinion obtained here will be very useful to us in Natal.

particularly represent the Indians in Natal, who number about fifty
thousand. The first Indians were, of course, the coolies who were taken
over under indentures from Madras and Bengal for the purpose of
labouring in the various plantations. They were mostly Hindus, but a
few of them were Mohammedans. They served their contract time, and
on obtaining their freedom they elected to stay in the country,
because they found that, as market gardeners or hawkers of
vegetables, they could earn from three to four pounds sterling per
month. In this way, there are, at present, about thirty thousand free
Indians settled in the Colony, while some sixteen thousand others are
serving their indentures. There is, however, another class of Indians,
numbering about five thousand, Mohammedans from the Bombay
side who have been attracted to the country by the prospects of trade.
Some of the latter are doing well. Many are landowners in a large way,
while two own ships. The Indians have been settled in the country for
twenty years and more, and, being prosperous, were contented and
happy.

New Para:    [R*]    What then, was the cause of all the present trouble, Mr* Gandhi?
[G*] Simply trade jealousy. The Colony was desirous of
securing all possible benefit from the Indians as labourers, because the
natives of the country do not work in the fields, and the Europeans
cannot. But the moment the Indians entered into competition with the
European as a trader, he found himself thwarted, obstructed, and
insulted by a system of organized persecution. And gradually, this
feeling of hatred and oppression has been imported into the laws of
the Colony. The Indians had been quietly enjoying the franchise for
years, subject to certain property qualifications, and, in 1894, there
were 251 Indian voters on the register against 9,309 European voters.
But the Government suddenly thought, or pretended to think, that
there was danger of the Asiatic vote swamping the European, and they
introduced into the Legislative Assembly a Bill disfranchising all
Asiatics save those who were then rightly contained in any Voters’
List. Against this Bill, the Indians memorialized both the Legislative
Assembly and the Legislative Council; but to no purpose, and the Bill
was passed into law. The Indians then memorialized Lord Ripon, who
was in those days at the Colonial Office. As a result, that Act has now
been repealed and replaced by an Act which says: ‘The natives, or
descendants in the male line of natives, of countries which have not

whom are coolies, who would never have aspired to free institutions in their own
country—are desirous of wielding political power in Natal?
[G*]  By no means. We are most careful to put out, in all our
representations to the Government and the public, that the object of
our agitation is merely the removal of vexatious disabilities devised, as
we believe, to degrade us as compared to the European population.
With the object of still further discouraging Indian colonization, the
Natal Legislature has passed a Bill to keep indentured Indians under
contract for the whole term of their stay in the Colony; and if they
object to renew their contract at the end of their first term of five
years, to send them back to India, or, if they decline to return, to
compel them to pay an annual tax of £3 per head. Unfortunately for
us, the Indian Government, on the ex parte representation of a
Commission that visited India from Natal in 1893, have accepted the
principle of compulsory indenture; but we are memorializing both the
Home and the Indian Governments against it.

New Para:  In India the British, the Hindu and the Mussalman communities find
themselves face to face with the question as to whether, at the outset of the
new industrial movements which have been so long and anxiously awaited,
Indian traders and workers are or are not to have the same status before the law
as all other British subjects enjoy. May they or may they not go freely from
one British possession to another and claim the rights of British subjects in
allied States? Or are they to be treated as outcaste races, subjected to a system
of permits and passes when travelling on their ordinary business avocations,
and relegated, as the Transvaal Government would relegate them, to a ghetto
at the permanent centres of their trade? These are questions which apply to all
Indians who seek to better their fortunes outside the limits of the Indian
Empire. Mr* Chamberlain’s words and the determined attitude taken up by
every section of the Indian Press show that to such questions there can be but
one answer.
It is clear therefore, that the question affects not only the
Indians at present residing in South Africa but all who may wish to
seek fortunes outside India, and that there can be but one answer to
the question. I hope there will be only one answer.
 
If all the Associations, Anglo-Indian and Indian, were to protest
against the disabilities that are being heaped upon the Indians in that
country, and if every important town in India were to hold meetings to
express disapproval of the ill-treatment, I venture to think that it will
not be doing too much.
It is necessary that the public here should know what activity the
various Governments in South Africa are showing and what pressure is
being placed upon the Colonial Office at home to bring the matter to
a successful issue from their standpoint. Public meetings are being
held all over the country asking the Governments to put a stop to the
‘coolie’ immigration. Mayors of the different towns have been
meeting in congress and passing resolutions desiring the restriction of
the Asiatic influx. Sir Gordon Sprigg, the Cape Premier, is in active
communication with the Colonial Office about the matter and is
hopeful of a satisfactory result. Mr* Maydon, a prominent politician in
Natal, has been telling his audiences that the friends of the Colony in
England are doing every thing to vigorously put forward the Colonial

New Para:  [Q*]  Is the competition a legitimate one? I mean, is it entered into and
conducted on a fair and open basis?
[A*]  The competition is an open one and conducted by the
Indians in a perfectly fair and legitimate manner. Perhaps a word or
two as to the general system of trading may make matters clear. The
bulk of Indians engaged in trafficking are those who get their goods
from the large European wholesal houses, and then go about the
country hawking them. Why, I may say that the Colony of Natal, of
which I speak particularly from knowledge and experience, is
practically dependent for its supplies on these travelling traders. As
you know, shops are scarce in those parts, at least away from the
towns, and the Indian gets an honest livelihood by supplying the
deficiency. It is said that the petty  European trader has been
displaced. This is true to a certain extent; but then it has been the fault
of the European trader. He has been content to stop in his shop, and
customers have been compelled to come to him. It is not to be
wondered at, therefore, that when the Indian, at no small trouble, takes
the goods to the customers, he readily finds a sale. Moreover, the
European trader, no matter in however small a way, will not hawk his
goods about. Perhaps the strongest proof of the trading capabilities of
the Indian and, generally speaking, of his integrity, is to be found in
the fact that the great houses will give him credit, and, in fact, many of
them do the bulk of their trade through his agency. It is no secret that

New Para:  [Q*]  What, briefly, are the legal and other disabilities placed upon the Indian
residents in Natal?
[A*]  Well, first there is the ‘curfew’ law which prohibits all
‘coloured’ persons being out after 9 o’clock at night without a permit
from their master, if indentured servants, or unless they can give a
good account of themselves. The great cause of complaint on this
score is that this law may be used by the police as an engine of
oppression. Respectable, well-dressed, educated Indians are sometimes
subjected to the humiliation of arrest by a policeman, being marched
to the lock-up, incarcerated for the night, brought before the
magistrate next morning and dismissed without a word of apology
when their bona fides have been established. Such occurrences are by
no means rare. Then there is the deprivation of the franchise, which
was brought out in the article you published. The fact is the Colonists
do not want the Indian to form part of the South African nation—
hence the taking away from him of franchise rights. As a menial he
can be tolerated, as a citizen never.

New Para:  [Q*]  What has been the attitude of the Indians on this question of the exercise
of political rights in an alien country?
[A*]  Simply that of the person who claims to enjoy the same
rights and privileges in a country as those who are not native to the
country freely enjoy. Politically speaking, the Indian does not want
the vote; it is only because he resents the indignity of being dispos
sessed of it that he is agitating for its restitution. Moreover, the
classifying of all Indians in one category and the non-recognition of
the just place of the better class is felt to be a great injustice. We have
even proposed the raising of the property qualifications and the
introduction of the education test, which would surely give the hall-
mark of fitness to every Indian voter, but this has been
contemptuously rejected, proving that the sole object is that of
discrediting the Indian and depriving him of all political power, so
that he will be forever helpless. Then there is the crippling imposition
of the £3 poll tax per annum on all who remain in the country after
fulfilling their indenture. Again, the Indian has no social status; in
fact, he is regarded as a social leper—a pariah. Indignities of all kinds

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 458, 2, 5, 1068835) [A.] In Zululand no Indians can buy landed property in the townships of Nondweni and Eshowe.
New Para:  [Q*]  Why was the prohibition imposed?
[A*]  Well, in the township of Melmoth, which was the first
established in Zululand, there were no regulations and the Natal
Indians availed themselves of the right to buy landed property, which
they did to the extent of over £2,000 worth. Then the prohibition was
passed and made to apply to townships subsequently founded. It was
purely trade jealousy, the fear being that the Indians would enter
Zululand for trade purposes as they had done in Natal.
In the Orange River Free State, the purchase of any property by
an Indian has been made impossible by simply classifying him with
the Kaffir. It is not permitted him to hold immovable property, and
every Indian settler in the State has to pay an annual tax of ten
shillings. The injustice of these arbitrary laws may be gauged from the
fact that when they were promulgated the Indians, mostly traders, were
compelled to leave the State without the slightest compensation,
causing losses to the extent of £9,000* Matters in the Transvaal are
hardly any better. Laws have been passed which prohibit the Indian
from engaging in trade or residing otherwise than in specific
localities. On the latter point, however, proceedings are pending in the
law-courts. A special registration fee of £7 has to be paid, the 9
o’clock rule is operative, walking on the foot-path is forbidden (at
least this is so in Johannesburg), and travelling first and second class
on the railways is not permitted. So you will see that the Indian’s life
in the Transvaal is not altogether a pleasant one. And yet, in spite of
all these disabilities, nay, unwarrantable indignities and insults, the
Indian, unless Mr* Chamberlain interferes, will be liable to compulsory
military service. According to the Commandeering Treaty, all British
subjects were exempted from this service, but, when the Transvaal
Volksraad was considering the point, they added a resolution to the
effect that the British subjects means “whites” only. The Indians,
however, memorialized the Home Government on this question. Cape

('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 458, 3, 17, 1070495) And yet, in spite of all these disabilities, nay, unwarrantable indignities and insults, the Indian, unless Mr. Chamberlain interferes, will be liable to compulsory military service.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 458, 3, 18, 1070678) According to the Commandeering Treaty, all British subjects were exempted from this service, but, when the Transvaal Volksraad was considering the point, they added a resolution to the effect that the British subjects means “whites” only.
('Mahatma Gandhi: Collected Works, Volume 1', 458, 3, 19, 1070917) The Indians, however, memorialized the Home Government on this question.

New Para:  Colony, following on the same lines, has recently empowered the East
London Municipality to prohibit trading by Indians, walking on the
foot-paths and limiting them to residence in certain locations. So you
see almost everywhere in South Africa there is a dead set against the
Indians. Yet we ask no special privileges, we only claim our just rights.
Political power is not our ambition, but to be let alone to carry on our
trading, for which we are eminently suited as a nation, is all we ask.
This is, we think, a reasonable demand.

New Para:  [Q*]  So much for these grievances, which seem to be general through out
South Africa. Now tell me, Mr* Gandhi, how do Indian advocates fare in the law-
courts?
[A*]  Oh! there is no distinction between advocates and attorneys
of whatever race; in the courts, it is only a question of ability. There
are many lawyers in the Colony, but, on the whole, forensic talent
cannot be said to be of a very high order. A good many European
pleaders are to be found, and it goes without saying that those with
English training and degrees monopolize the practice of the courts.
But I suppose it is the English degree, for those of us who have taken
it, which places us more on a level footing. Those with an Indian
degree only would be out of place. There is scope, I believe, for
Indian lawyers in South Africa, if at all sympathetically disposed to
their fellow-countrymen.

New Para:  SIR,

New Para:  With reference to my letter in connection with the grievances of
the Indians in South Africa, dated the 13th instant,
2 I happened to read
the original telegram received from South Africa. It reads “raad” and
not “road” as in the message received by me in Calcutta. The
meaning is now quite clear. It is that the Transvaal Government are
enforcing Indians to locations. This makes the matter still more
serious, if possible.

think, constitutes a breach of international courtesy, if nothing more. I
venture to remind you that the assets of the Indians in the Transvaal
amount to over £100,000, and that removal to locations would
practically mean ruin to the Indian traders. The question, therefore, in
